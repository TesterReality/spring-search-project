Sure enough the coals of her dying fire are still hot I cut up the rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over the coals Im glad for the cameras now I want sponsors to see I can hunt that Im a good bet because I wont
be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger While the rabbit cooks I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack The black tones it down but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help Of course to have
mud Id need water    I pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over the coals and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went I eat half the rabbit as I go then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later The
meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst Water is my top priority now As I hike along I feel certain Im still holding the screen in the Capitol so Im careful to continue to hide my emotions But what a good time Claudius
Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators dissecting Peetas behavior my reaction What to make of it all Has Peeta revealed his true colors How does this affect the betting odds Will we lose sponsors Do we even have sponsors Yes I feel certain we do or at least
did Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our starcrossed loverdynamic Or has he Maybe since he hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some mileage out of it Maybe people will think its something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now The sun
rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its no use Its only been a day and Im dehydrating fast I try and think of everything I know
about finding water It runs downhill so in fact continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation these might help me along but nothing seems to change Theres just the slight gradual slope
the birds the sameness to the trees As the day wears on I know Im headed for trouble What little urine Ive been able to pass is a dark brown my head is aching and theres a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten The sun hurts my
eyes so I dig out my sunglasses but when I put them on they do something funny to my vision so I just stuff them back in my pack Its late afternoon when I think Ive foundhelp I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit
to suck thesweet juices from the skins But just as Im holding them to my lips I get a hard look at them What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape and when I break one open the insides are bloodred I dont recognize these berries perhaps they
are edible but Im guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 percent sure they werent toxic Something I already knew but Im so thirsty
it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away Fatigue is beginning to settle on me but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike I have to stop and rest frequently although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued
searching I try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water But as far as I can see in any direction theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest Determined to go on until nightfall I walk
until Im stumbling over my own feet Exhausted I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in Ive no appetite but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do Night falls the anthem plays and high in the sky I see the
picture of the girl who was apparently from District 8 The one Peeta wentback to finish off My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst Besides they were heading away from me and by now they too will have to rest With the scarcity of
water they may even have had to return to the lake for refills Maybe that is the only course for me as well Morning brings distress My heads throbs with every beat of my heart Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints I fall rather than jump from
the tree It takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear Somewhere inside me I know this is wrong I should be acting with more caution moving with more urgency But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard I lean back against the trunk of my
tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue as I assess my options How can I get water Return to the lake No good Id never make it Hope for rain Theres not a cloud in the sky Keep looking Yes this is my only chance But
then another thought hits me and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses Haymitch He could send me water Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes I know I must have sponsors at least one or two

harmless
they dont want people in different districts to know about one another At Rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan ahead Shes seen most of mine but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile Shes gathered quite a collection of roots
nuts greens and even some berries I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers You sure this is safe Oh yes we have them back home Ive been eating them for days she says popping a handful in her mouth I tentatively bite into one and its as good as
our blackberries Taking Rue on as an allyseems a better choice all the time We divide up our food supplies so in case were separated well both be set for a few days Apart from the food Rue has a small water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair
of socks She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife I know its not much she says as if embarrassed but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast You did just right I say When I spread out my gear she gasps a
little when she sees the sunglasses How did you get those she asks In my pack Theyve been useless so far They dont block the sun and they make it harder to see I say with a shrug These arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims Rue Sometimes when we
harvest through the night theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees Where the torchlight doesnt reach One time this boy Martin he tried to keep his pair Hid it in his pants They killed him on the spot They killed a boy for
taking these I say Yes and everyone knew he was no danger Martin wasnt right in the head I mean he still acted like a threeyearold He just wanted the glasses to play with says Rue Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven
Of course people keel over from starvation all the time but I cant imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child Theres a littlegirl one of Greasy Saes grandkids who wanders around the Hob Shes not quite right but shes treated as a sort of pet People toss her scraps and
things So what do these do I ask Rue taking the glasses They let you see in complete darkness says Rue Try them tonight when the sun goesdown I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again We
extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall Where do you sleep I ask her In the trees She nods In just your jacket Rue holds up her extra pair of socks I have these for my hands I think of how cold the nights have been You
can share my sleeping bag if you want Well both easily fit Her face lights up I can tell this is more than she dared hope for We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play There were
no deaths today Rue I only woke up today How many nights did I miss The anthem should block out our words but still I whisper I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand I dont want the audience to know what Im planning to tell
her about Peeta Taking a cue from me she does the same Two she says Thegirls from Districts One and Four are dead Theres ten of us left Something strange happened At least I think it did It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things I
say You know the boy from my district Peeta I think he saved my life But he was with the Careers Hes not with them now she says Ive spied on their base camp by the lake They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers But hes not
there Maybe he did save you and had to run I dont answer If in fact Peeta did save me Im in his debt again And this cant be paid back If he did it was all probably just part of his act You know to make people think hes
in love with me Oh says Rue thoughtfully I didnt think that was an act Course it is I say He worked it out with our mentor The anthem ends and the sky goes dark Lets try out these glasses I pull out the glasses and slip them on Rue
wasnt kidding I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away I could kill it from here if I had a mind to I could kill anyone I wonder who else got a pair of these I
say The Careers have two pairs But theyve got everything down by the lake Rue says And theyre so strong Were strong too I say Just in a different way You are You can shoot she says What can I do You can feedyourself Can they I ask They dont
need to They have all those supplies Rue says Say they didnt Say the supplies were gone How long would they last I say I mean its the Hunger Games right But Katniss theyre not hungry says Rue No theyre not Thats the problem I agree And for the first
time I have a plan A plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion An offensive plan I think were going to have to fix that Rue16Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up

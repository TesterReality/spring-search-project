ferocity
Im not witty Funny Sexy Or mysterious By the end of thesession I am no one at all Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty and a nasty edge has crept into his voice I give up sweetheart Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how
openly you despise them I have dinner that night in my room ordering an outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick and then taking out my anger at Haymitch at the Hunger Games at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room When the girl with
the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes widen at the mess Just leave it I yell at her Just leave it alone I hate her too with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the Capitol both now
and then For her justice must finally be happening At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods But instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom She comes back with a damp cloth
and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands Why is she doing this Why am I letting her I should have tried to save you I whisper She shakes her head Does this mean we were right to stand by That she
has forgiven me No it was wrong I say She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest I think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox too Probably would have An Avox or dead I spend the next hour helping the redheaded
girl clean the room When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away she turns down my bed I crawl in between the sheets like a fiveyearold and let her tuck me in Then she goes I want her to stay until I fall
asleep To be there when I wake up I want the protection of this girl even though she never had mine In the morning its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over This day belongs to Cinna
Hes my last hope Maybe hecan make me look so wonderful no one will care what comes out of my mouth The team works on me until late afternoon turning my skin to glowing satin stenciling patterns on my arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails Then Venia
goes to work on my hair weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear wraps around my head and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out Huge
dark eyes full red lips lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink Finally they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress but I cant really see it because its covered
Close your eyes he orders I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body then the weight It must be forty pounds I clutch Octavias hand as I blindly step into my shoes glad to find they are at least two inches lower thanthe
pair Effie had me practice in Theres some adjusting and fidgeting Then silence Can I open my eyes I ask Yes says Cinna Open them The creature standing before me in the fulllength mirror has come from another world Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their
clothes from jewels Because my dress oh my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire I am not pretty
I am not beautiful I am as radiant as the sun For a while we all just stare at me Oh Cinna I finally whisper Thank you Twirl for me he says I hold out my arms and spin in a circle The prep team screams in admiration Cinna dismisses
the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more manageable than Effies The dress hangs in such a way that I dont have to lift the skirt when I walk leaving me with one less thing to worry about So all ready for
the interview then asks Cinna I can see by his expression that hes been talking to Haymitch That he knows how dreadful I am Im awful Haymitch called me a dead slug No matter what we tried I couldnt do it I just cant be one of those people he
wants me to be I say Cinna thinks about this a moment Why dont you just be yourself Myself Thats no good either Haymitch says Im sullen and hostile I say Well you are    Around Haymitch says Cinna with a grin I dont find you so Theprep
team adores you You even won over the Gamemakers And as for the citizens of the Capitol well they cant stop talking about you No one can help but admire your spirit My spirit This is a new thought Im not sure exactly what it means but it suggests Im
a fighter In a sort of brave way Its not as if Im never friendly Okay maybe I dont go around loving everybody I meet maybe my smiles are hard to come by but I do care for some people Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones

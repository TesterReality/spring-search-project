But
a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prims place and now it seems I have become someone precious At first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to
me It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals It means thanks it means admiration it means goodbye to someone you love Now I am truly in danger of crying but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to
congratulate me Look at her Look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders Hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck I like her His breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed Lots of    He cant think of
the word for a while Spunk he says triumphantly More than you he releases me and starts for the front of the stage More than you he shouts pointing directly into acamera Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol Ill
never know because just as hes opening his mouthto continue Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious Hes disgusting but Im grateful With every camera gleefully trained on him I have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself I put
my hands behind my back and stare into the distance I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale For a moment I yearn for something    The idea of us leaving the district    Making our way in the woods   
But I know I was right about not running off Because who else would have volunteered for Prim Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again What an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which
has listed severely to the right But more excitement to come Its time to choose our boy tribute Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she
encounters She zips back to the podium and I dont even have time to wishfor Gales safety when shes reading the name Peeta Mellark Peeta Mellark Oh no I think Not him Because I recognize this name although I have never spoken directly to its owner Peeta Mellark No the
odds are not in my favor today I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage Medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead The shock of the moment is registering on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless
but his blue eyes show the alarm Ive seen so often in prey Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place Effie Trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward He has two older brothers I know Ive seen them in the bakery but one is
probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont This is standard Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day What I did was the radical thing The mayor begins to read the long dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this
point its required but Im not listening to a word Why him I think Then I try to convince myself it doesnt matter Peeta Mellark and I are not friends Not even neighbors We dont speak Our only real interaction happened years ago Hes probably forgotten it But I havent
and I know I never will    It was during the worst time My father had beenkilled in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember The numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling
me over racking my body with sobs Where are you I would cry out in my mind Where have you gone Of course there was never any answer The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving
at which time my mother would be expected to get a job Only she didnt She didnt do anything but sit propped up in achair or more often huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance Once in a while shed stir get
up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her I was terrified I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all I knew was
that I had lost not only a father but a mother as well At eleven years old with Prim just seven I took over as head of the family There was no choice I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to
keep Prim and myself looking presentableBecause if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home Id grown up seeing those home kids at school The sadness the marks of
angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward I could never let that happen to Prim Sweet tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished

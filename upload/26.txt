a
shot at spear throwing he whispers to me I think we have a shadow I throw my spear which Im not too bad at actually if I dont have to throw too far and see the little girl from District 11 standing back a bit watching us Shes the twelveyearold
the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature Up close she looks about ten She has bright dark eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound
Its impossible not to think of a bird I pick up another spear while Peeta throws I think her names Rue he says softly I bite my lip Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow Rue Primrose Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy
pounds soaking wet What can we do about it I ask him more harshly than I intended Nothing to do he says back Just making conversation Now that I know shes there its hard to ignore the child She slips up and joins us at different stations Like me shes
clever with plants climbs swiftly and has good aim She can hit the target every time with a slingshot But what is a slingshot against a 220pound male with a sword Back on the District 12 floor Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of
the day What we did who watched us how the other tributes size upCinna and Portia arent around so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore Instead they seem to be of one mind determined to whip us into
shape Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training Peeta is more patient but I become fed up and surly When we finally escape to bed on the second night Peeta mumbles Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink I make a sound that
is somewhere between a snort and a laugh Then catch myself Its messing with my mind too much trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not At least when we get into the arena Ill know where we stand Dont Dont lets pretend when theres no
one around All right Katniss he says tiredly After that we only talk in front of people On the third day of training they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers District by district first the boy then the girl tribute As usual
District 12 is slated to go last We linger in the dining room unsure where else to go No one comes back once they have left As the room empties the pressure to appear friendly lightens By the time they call Rue we are left alone We sit in silence
until they summon Peeta He rises Remember what Haymitch saidabout being sure to throw the weights The words come out of my mouth without permission Thanks I will he says You    Shoot straight I nod I dont know why I said anything at all Although if Im
going to lose Id rather Peeta win than the others Better for our district for my mother and Prim After about fifteen minutes they call my name I smooth my hair set my shoulders back and walk into the gymnasium Instantly I know Im in trouble Theyve been here too
long the Gamemakers Sat through twentythree other demonstrations Had too much to wine most of them Want more than anything to go home Theres nothing I can do but continue with the plan I walk to the archery station Oh the weapons Ive been itching to get my hands on
them for days Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I cant even name Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines I choose a bow string it and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder Theres a shooting range but its much too limited
Standard bullseyes and human silhouettes I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target The dummy used for knife practice Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong The strings tighter than the one I use at home The arrows more
rigid I missthe dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding For a moment Im humiliated then I head back to the bullseye I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons Back in the center of the
gymnasium I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground Without pausing I shoulderroll forward come up on one knee and send an arrow
into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture Its excellent shooting I turn to the Gamemakers A few are nodding approval but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet
table Suddenly I am furious that with my life on the line they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me That Im being upstaged by a dead pig My heart starts to pound I can feel my face burning Without thinking I pull an arrow from my
quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers table I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back The arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it Everyone stares at me in disbelief Thank you for your consideration I say Then

I
guess the foxfaced girl made it Both tributes from 6 and 7 The boy from 8 Both from 9 Yes theres the boy who I fought for the backpack Ive run through my fingers only one more dead tribute to go Is it Peeta No theres the girl from District
10 Thats it The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume Im relieved Peetas alive I tell myself again that if I get killed his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most This is what I tellmyself
to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview The anger at his superiority on the roof The dread that we may come facetoface at any moment in this arena
Eleven dead but none from District 12 I try to work out who is left Five Career Tributes Foxface Thresh and Rue Rue    So she made it through the first day after all I canthelp feeling glad That makes ten of us The other three Ill figure
out tomorrow Now when it is dark and I have traveled far and I am nestled high in this tree now I must try and rest I havent really slept in two days and then theres been the long days journey into the arena Slowly I allow my muscles to
relax My eyes to close The last thing I think is its lucky I dont snore    Snap The sound of a breaking branch wakes me How long have I been asleep Four hours Five The tip of my nose is icy cold Snap Snap Whats going on
This is not the sound of a branch under someones foot but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree Snap Snap I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right Slowly noiselessly I turn myself in that direction For a few minutes theres nothing but blackness
and some scuffling Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom A pair of hands warms over flames but I cant make out more than that I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter What are
they thinking A fire Ill just at nightfall would have been one thing Those who battled at the Cornucopia with their superior strength and surplus of supplies they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then But now when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours
looking for victims You might as well be waving a flag and shouting Come and get me And here I am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the Games Strapped in a tree Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer
who cares I mean I know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of
this tree I wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor My instinct has been to flee not fight But obviously this persons a hazard Stupid people are dangerous And this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while Ive got this excellent knifeThe sky
is still dark but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching Im beginning to think we meaning the person whose death Im now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed Then I hear it Several pairs of feet breaking into a run The fire starter must
have dozed off Theyre on her before she can escape I know its a girl now I can tell by the pleading the agonized scream that follows Then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices Someone cries out Twelve down and eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative
hoots So theyre fighting in a pack Im not really surprised Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games The strong band together to hunt down the weak then when the tension becomes too great begin to turn on one another I dont have to wonder too
hard who has made this alliance Itll be the remaining CareerTributes from Districts 1 2 and 4 Two boys and three girls The ones who lunched together For a moment I hear them checking the girl for supplies I can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good I wonder
if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought Shes much too bright to be building a fire like that Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking Im almost certain thats the brutish boy from District 2 There are murmurs of assent and
then to my horror I hear the pack heading toward me They do not know Im here How could they And Im well concealed in the clump of trees At least while the sun stays down Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble If they just
keep moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree They have flashlights torches I can see an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the branches I turn to stone not even
daring to breathe Have they spotted me No not yet I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere Shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now Id say yes Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately Unless she isnt dead Shes dead I stuck her myself

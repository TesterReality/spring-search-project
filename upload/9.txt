trade
like milk or medicine I dont bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous The woods terrified her and whenever I shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we
got it home soon enough But she makes out well with her goat so I concentrate on that When I am done with instructions about fueland trading and staying in school I turn to my mother and grip her arm hard Listen to me Are you listening to me She
nods alarmed by my intensity She must know whats coming You cant leave again I say My mothers eyes find the floor I know I wont I couldnt help what Well you have to help it this time You cant clock out and leave Prim on her own Theres no
me now to keep you both alive It doesnt matter what happens Whatever you see on the screen You have to promise me youll fight through it My voice has risen to a shout In it is all the anger all the fear I felt at her abandonment She pulls
her arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now I was ill I could have treated myself if Id had the medicine I have now That part about her being ill might be true Ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since Perhaps it is a
sickness but its one we cant afford Then take it And take care of her I say Ill be all right Katniss says Prim clasping my face in her hands But you have to take care too Youre so fast and brave Maybe you can win I cant win Prim
must know that in her heart The competition will be far beyond my abilities Kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole lives for this Boys who are two to three times my size Girlswho know twenty different ways to kill you with
a knife Oh therell be people like me too People to weed out before the real fun begins Maybe I say because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if Ive already given up myself Besides it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even
when things seem insurmountable Then wed be rich as Haymitch I dont care if were rich I just want you to come home You will try wont you Really really try asks Prim Really really try I swear it I say And I know because of Prim Ill have to
And then the Peacekeeper is at the door signaling our time is up and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all Im saying is I love you I love you both And theyre saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door
closes I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out Someone else enters the room and when I look up Im surprised to see its the baker Peeta Mellarks father I cant believe hes come to visit me After all
Ill be trying to kill his son soon But we do know each other a bit and he knows Prim even better When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return
We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wifeisnt around because hes so much nicer I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread But why has he come to see me The baker sits awkwardly on
the edge of one of the plush chairs Hes a big broadshouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens He musthave just said goodbye to his son He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me I open it and find
cookies These are a luxury we can never afford Thank you I say The bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times and today he has no words at all I had some of your bread this morning My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it
He nods as if remembering the squirrel Not your best trade I say He shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter Then I cant think of anything else so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him He rises and coughs to clear his throat Ill keep an eye
on the little girl Make sure shes eating I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words People deal with me but they are genuinely fond of Prim Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive My next guest is also unexpected Madge walks
straight to me She is not weepyor evasive instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena One thing to remind you of home Will you wear this She holds out the circular gold pin that was
on her dress earlier I hadnt paid much attention to it before but now I see its a small bird in flight Your pin I say Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind Here Ill put it on your dress all right Madge
doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress Promise youll wear it into the arena Katniss she asks Promise Yes I say Cookies A pin Im getting all kinds of gifts today Madge gives me one more A kiss on the

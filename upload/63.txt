hearthings
that humans cant I pause my eyes focused on whats ahead not whats happening behind me It doesnt take long then the general birdsong begins again and I know shes gone Another mockingjay a young one by the look of it lands on a branch before me and bursts out
Rues melody My song the hovercraft were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of notes The ones that mean shes safe Good and safe I say as I pass under its branch We dont have to worry about her now Good and
safe Ive no idea where to go The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished My feet wander this way and that until sunset Im not afraid not even watchful Which makes me an easy target Except Id kill anyone I met on sight
Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least Especially the Careers They at least can be made to pay for Rues death No one materializes though There arent many of us left and
its a big arena Soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together But theres been enough gore today Perhaps well even get to sleep Im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front
of me A gift from a sponsor But why now Ive been in fairly good shape with supplies Maybe Haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit Or could it be something to help my ear I open the parachute and find a small loaf
of bread Its not the fine white Capitol stuff Its made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent Sprinkled with seeds I flash back to Peetas lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center This bread came from District 11 I cautiously lift the still warm
loaf What must it have cost the people of District 11 who cant even feed themselves How many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf It had been meant for Rue surely But instead of pulling the gift
when she died theyd authorized Haymitch to give it to me As a thankyou Or because like me they dont like to let debts go unpaid For whatever reason this is a first A district gift to a tribute whos not your own I lift my face and step into
the last falling rays ofsunlight My thanks to the people of District Eleven I say I want them to know I know where it came from That the full value of their gift has been recognized I climb dangerously high into a tree not for safety but to get as
far away from today as I can My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rues pack Tomorrow Ill sort through the supplies Tomorrow Ill make a new plan But tonight all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread Its good It tastes of
home Soon the seals in the sky the anthem plays in my right ear I see the boy from District 1 Rue Thats all for tonight Six of us left I think Only six Withthe bread still locked in my hands I fall asleep at once Sometimes when things are
particularly bad my brain will give me a happy dream A visit with my father in the woods An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim Tonight it sends me Rue still decked in her flowers perched in a high sea of trees trying to teach me to talk to
the mockingjays I see no sign of her wounds no blood just a bright laughing girl She sings songs Ive never heard in a clear melodic voice On and on Through the night Theres a drowsy inbetween period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although
shes lost in the leaves When I fully awaken Im momentarily comforted I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream but it quickly slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever Heaviness infuses my whole body as if theres liquid lead in my veins Ive
lost the will to do the simplest tasks to do anything but lie here staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves For several hours I remain motionless As usual its the thought of Prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my
lethargy I give myself a series of simple commands to follow like Now you have to sit up Katniss Now you have to drink water Katniss I act on the orders with slow robotic motions Now you have to sort the packs Katniss Rues pack holds my sleeping bag her
nearly empty water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of rabbit her extra socks and her slingshot The boy from District 1 has several knives two spare spearheads a flashlight a small leather pouch a firstaid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried
fruit A pack of dried fruit Out of all he might have chosen from To me this is a sign of extreme arrogance Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp When you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before yourehungry
I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing Speaking of which my own supply is running low I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit How quickly the food disappears

who
could afford a pint of liquid for me Yes its pricey but these people theyre made of money And theyllbe betting on me as well Perhaps Haymitch doesnt realize how deep my need is I say in a voice as loud as I dare Water I wait hopefully for a
parachute to descend from the sky But nothing is forthcoming Something is wrongAm I deluded about having sponsors Or has Peetas behavior made them all hang back No I dont believe it Theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go
through As my mentor he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors I know he hates me Hes made that clear enough But enough to let me die From this He cant do that can he If a mentor mistreats his tributes hell be held accountable by
the viewers by the people back in District 12 Even Haymitch wouldnt risk that would he Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob but I dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way And then where would he get his
liquor So    What Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta Is he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment Somehow I dont believe that and I dont believe hes trying to
kill me off by neglect either He has in fact in his own unpleasant way genuinely been trying to prepare me for this Then what is going on I bury my face in my hands Theres no danger of tears now I couldnt produce one to save my life What
is Haymitch doing Despite my anger hatred and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer Maybe hes sending you a message it says A message Saying what Then I know Theres only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me Because he
knows Ive almost found it I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet My backpack seems to have tripled in weight I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off The suns beating down even more searing than the first two
days I feel like an old piece of leather drying and cracking in the heat Every step is an effort but I refuse to stop I refuse to sit down If I sit theres a good chance I wont be able to get up again that I wont even remember
my task What easy prey I am Any tribute even tiny Rue could take me right now merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife and Id have little strength to resist But if anyone is in my part of the woods they ignore me The truth
is I feel a million miles from another living soul Not alone though No theyve surely got a camera tracking me now I think back tothe years of watching tributes starve freeze bleed and dehydrate to death Unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere Im being featured My
thoughts turn to Prim Its likely she wont be watching me live but theyll show updates at the school during lunch For her sake I try to look as least desperate as I can But by afternoon I know the end is coming My legs are shaking and my heart
too quick I keep forgetting exactly what Im doing Ive stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides out from under me I finally tumble to the ground unable to get up I let my eyes close I have misjudged Haymitch He has nointention of
helping me at all This is all right I think This is not so bad here The air is less hot signifying evenings approach Theres a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies My fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily across the top This is an okay place
to die I think My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool slippery earth I love mud I think How many times Ive tracked game with the help of its soft readable surface Good for bee stings too Mud Mud Mud My eyes fly open and I dig my
fingers into the earth It is mud My nose lifts in the air And those are lilies Pond lilies I crawl now through the mud dragging myself toward the scent Five yards from where I fell I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond Floating on the top
yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful lilies Its all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold But I have just enough sense left to abstain With trembling hands I get out my flask and fill it
with water I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it The half an hour of waiting is agony but I do it At least I think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as I can stand Slowly
easy now I tell myself I take one swallow and make myself wait Then another Over the next couple of hours I drink the entire half gallon Then a second I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in one
of my precious crackers By the time the anthem plays I feel remarkably better There are no faces tonight no tributes died today Tomorrow Ill stay here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped digging up the roots of

every
screen in Panem No blood trails I tell myself and manage to pull my hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin with uncooperativefingers That should help soak up the blood I cant walk but can I crawl I move forward tentatively Yes if I go very
slowly I can crawl Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover My only hope is to make it back to Rues copse and conceal myself in greenery I cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open Not only will I face death its sure
to be a long and painful one at Catos hand The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout Another blast knocks me flat on my face A stray mine set off by some collapsing crate This happens twice more Im reminded
of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes atthe base of the trees when theres Cato
barreling onto the plain soon followed by his companions His rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if I didnt know that it was aimed at me at what I have done to him
Add to that my proximity my inability to run or defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me terrified Im glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because Im biting my nails like theres no tomorrow Gnawing off
the last bits of nail polish trying to keep my teeth from chattering The boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out
his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers The other tributes are poking around in the mess looking for anything to salvage but theres nothing The boy from District 3 has done his job too well This idea must occur to Cato too because he turns on
the boy and appears to be shouting at him The boy from District 3 only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind I can see the muscles ripple in Catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the sideIts that
quick The death of the boy from District 3 The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down I can tell he wants to return to the woods but they keep pointing at the sky which puzzles me until I realize Of course They think whoever set
off the explosions is dead They dont know about the arrows and the apples They assume the booby trap was faulty but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it If there was a cannon shot it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions
The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3 And they wait I suppose a cannon goes off A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy The
sun dips belowthe horizon Night falls Up in the sky I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun A moment of darkness They show the boy from District 3 They show the boy from District 10 who must have died this morning Then the seal reappears So
now they know The bomber survived In the seals light I can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their nightvision glasses The boy from District 1 ignites atree branch for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all their faces The Careers stride back into the
woods to hunt The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened I can hear a ringing in my right which seems a good sign Theres no point in leaving my hiding place though Im about as safe as I can be here at the crime scene
They probably think the bomber has a two or threehour lead on them Still its a long time before I risk moving The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on which relaxes me a little to have at least one of my hunters
senses working I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today Where is my little ally
Did she make it back to the rendezvous point Is she worried about me At least the sky has shown were both alive I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers The boy from 1 both from 2 Foxface both from 11 and 12 Just eight of us The
betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol Theyll be doing special features on each of us now Probably interviewing our friends and families Its been a long time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight And now there are twoof us Although from
what Cato said Peetas on his way out Not that Cato is the final word on anything Didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies Let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games begin Cato I think Let them begin for real A cold breeze has sprung up I reach for

against
the rules says Peeta Only if they catch you That bruise will say you fought you werent caught even better says Haymitch He turns to me Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table The bow and arrow is my weapon But Ive spent a fair amount of
time throwing knives as well Sometimes if Ive wounded an animal with an arrow its better to get a knife into it too before I approach it I realize that if I want Haymitchs attention this is my moment to make an impression I yank the knife out of the
table get a grip on the blade and then throw it into the wallacross the room I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick but it lodges in the seam between two panels making me look a lot better than I am Stand over here Both of
you says Haymitch nodding to the middle of the room We obey and he circles us prodding us like animals at times checking our muscles examining our faces Well youre not entirely hopeless Seem fit And once the stylists get hold of you youll be attractive enough Peeta and I
dont question this The Hunger Games arent a beauty contest but the bestlooking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors All right Ill make a deal with you You dont interfere with my drinking and Ill stay sober enough to help you says Haymitch But you have to do exactly
what I say Its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all Fine says Peeta So help us I say When we get to the arena whats the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone One
thing at a time In a few minutes well be pulling into the station Youll be put in thehands of your stylists Youre not going to like what they do to you But no matter what it is dont resist says Haymitch But I begin No buts Dont resist says
Haymitch He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car As the door swings shut behind him the car goes dark There are still a few lights inside but outside its as if night has fallen again I realize we must be in the tunnel that
runs up through the mountains into the Capitol The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to
my being a tribute today Since the rebels had to scale the mountains they were easy targets for the Capitols air forces Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me
from the sky and my chest tightens I hate being encased in stone this way It reminds me of the mines and my father trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in the darkness The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment We cant help
it Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what weve only seen on television the Capitol the ruling city of Panem The cameras havent lied about its grandeur If anything they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings ina rainbow of hues that tower
into the air the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal All the colors seem artificial the pinks too deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to the eyes like the
flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District 12 The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city I step away from the window sickened by their excitement knowing they
cant wait to watch us die But Peeta holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd He only stops when the train pulls into the station blocking us from their view He sees me staring at him and shrugs Who knows he says One of them may
be rich I have misjudged him I think of his actions since the reaping began The friendly squeeze of my hand His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim    Did Peeta put him up to that His tears at the station Volunteering to
wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the niceguy approach had failed And now the waving at the window already trying to win the crowd All of the pieces are still fitting together but I sense he has a plan forming He hasnt acceptedhis death He is
already fighting hard to stay alive Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark the boy who gave me the bread isfighting hard to kill me5Riiip I grit my teeth as Venia a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg
tearing out the hair beneath it Sorry she pipes in her silly Capitol accent Youre just so hairy Why do these people speak in such a high pitch Why do their jaws barely open when they talk Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking
a question Odd vowels clipped words and always a hiss on the letter s    No wonder its impossible not to mimic them Venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face Good news though This is the last one Ready I get a grip on the

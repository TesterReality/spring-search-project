once
brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him The district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off told the family to take him home to die But they wouldnt accept this He lay on our kitchen table senseless to the world
I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh gaping charred flesh burned clear down to the bone before I ran from the house I went to the woods and hunted the entire day haunted by the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death Whats funny was Prim whos
scared of her own shadow stayed and helped My mother says healers are born not made They did their best but the man died just like the doctor said he would My leg is in need of attention but I still cant look at it What if its as bad
as the mans and I can see my bone Then I remember my mother saying that if a burns severe the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed Encouraged by this I sit up and swing my leg in front of me I almost faintat
the sight of my calf The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters I force myself to take deep slow breaths feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face I cant show weakness at this injury Not if I want help Pity does not get you aid Admiration
at your refusal to give in does I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely The burned area is about the size of my hand None of the skin is blackened I think its not too bad to soak Gingerly
I stretch out my leg into the pool propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh because this does offer some relief I know there are herbs if I could find them that would speed the healing but I cant
quite call them to mind Water and time will probably be all I have to work with Should I be moving on The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy If I do continue away from the fire wont I be walking straight into the weapons
of the Careers Besides every time I lift my leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in My hands are slightly less demanding They can handle small breaks from the pool So I slowly put my gear back in order First I
fill my bottle with the pool water treat it and when enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body After a timeI force myself to nibble on a cracker which helps settle my stomach I roll up my sleeping bag Except for a few black marks its relatively unscathed
My jackets another matter Stinking and scorched at leasta foot of the back beyond repair I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs But the hoods intact and its far better than nothing Despite the pain drowsiness begins
to take over Id take to a tree and try to rest except Id be too easy to spot Besides abandoning my pool seems impossible I neatly arrange my supplies even settle my pack on my shoulders but I cant seem to leave I spot some water plants with edible
roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit Sip water Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here I lean back on my pack overcome by drowsiness If the Careers want me let
them find me I think before drifting into a stupor Let them find me And find me they do Its lucky Im ready to move on because when I hear the feet I have less than a minute head start Evening has begun to fall The moment I awake Im
up and running splashing across the poolflying into the underbrush My leg slows me down but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire either I hear their coughs their raspy voices calling to one another Still they are closing in just like a
pack of wild dogs and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances I pick a high tree and begin to climb If running hurt climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark Im
fast though and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk Im twenty feet up For a moment we stop and survey one another I hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart This could be it I think What chance do I have against them All
six are there the five Careers and Peeta and my only consolation is theyre pretty beatup too Even so look at their weapons Look at their faces grinning and snarling at me a sure kill above them It seems pretty hopeless But then something else registers Theyre bigger and stronger
than I am no doubt but theyre also heavier Theres a reason its me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career Now I smile Hows
everything with you I call down cheerfully This takes them aback but I knowthe crowd will love it Well enough says the boy from District 2 Yourself Its been a bit warm for my taste I say I can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol The airs better

edges
of the table Im seated on and nod The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk Ive been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still havent met my stylist Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and
the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails into uniform shapes and primarily ridding my body of hair My
legs arms torso underarms and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff leaving me like a plucked bird ready for roasting I dont like it My skin feels sore and tinglingand intensely vulnerable But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch and no objection
has crossed my lips Youre doing very well says some guy named Flavius He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth If theres one thing we cant stand its a whiner Grease her down Venia and Octavia a plump
woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin Then they pull me from the table removing the thin robe Ive been allowed to wear off and on I stand there
completely naked as the three circle me wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair I know I should be embarrassed but theyre so unlike people that Im no more selfconscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet The three step back and
admire their work Excellent You almost look like a human being now says Flavius and they all laugh I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am Thank you I say sweetly We dont have much cause to look nice in District Twelve This wins
them over completely Of course you dont you poor darling says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me But dont worry says Venia By the time Cinna is through with you youre going to be absolutely gorgeous We promise You know now that weve gotten rid of all
the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says Flavius encouragingly Lets call Cinna They dart out of the room Its hard to hate my prep team Theyre such total idiots And yet in an odd way I knowtheyre sincerely trying to help me I look at the cold
white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe But this Cinna my stylist will surely make me remove it at once Instead my hands go to my hairdo the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone My fingers stroke
the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged My mother I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car never thinking about retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her of home Now I wish I had The door opens and
a young man who must be Cinna enters Im taken aback by how normal he looks Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed stenciled and surgically altered theyre grotesque But Cinnas closecropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown Hes in a simple black
shirt and pants The only concession to selfalteration seems to be metallic goldeyeliner that has been applied with a light hand It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes And despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions I cant help thinking how attractive it
looks Hello Katniss Im Cinna your stylist he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitols affectations Hello I venture cautiously Just give me a moment all right he asks He walks around my naked body not touching me but taking in every inch of it with his
eyes I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest Who did your hair My mother I say Its beautiful Classic really And in almost perfect balance with your profile She has very clever fingers he says I had expected someone flamboyant someone older trying desperately to look
young someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter Cinna has met none of these expectations Youre new arent you I dont think Ive seen you before I say Most of the stylists are familiar constants in the everchanging pool of tributes Some
have been around my whole life Yes this is my first year in the Games says Cinna So they gave you District Twelve I say Newcomers generally end up with us the least desirable district I asked for District Twelve he says without further explanation Why dont you put on
your robe and well have a chat Pulling on my robe I follow him through a door into a sitting room Two red couches face off over a low table Three walls are blank the fourth is entirely glass providing a window to the city I can see by the
light that it must be around noon although the sunny sky has turned overcast Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me He presses a button on the side of the table The top splits and from below rises a second
tabletop that holds our lunch Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped like flowers and for dessert a pudding the color of honey I try to imagineassembling this meal myself back

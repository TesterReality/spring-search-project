a
small bruise begins to form Do you want to talk Katniss Cinna asks I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him Cinna encloses it in both of his And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces its time to prepare
for launch Still clenching one of Cinnas hands I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate Remember what Haymitch said Run find water The rest will follow he says I nod And remember this Im not allowed to bet but if I could my money would be on
you Truly I whisper Truly says Cinna He leans down and kisses me on the forehead Good luck girl on fire And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me breaking our handhold cutting him off from me He taps his fingers under his chin Head high I lift my
chin and stand as straight as I can The cylinder begins to rise For maybe fifteen seconds Im in darkness and then I can feel the metal plate pushingme out of the cylinder into the open air For a moment my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and Im
conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees Then I hear the legendary announcer Claudius Templesmith as his voice booms all around me Ladies and gentlemen let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games begin11Sixty seconds Thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before
the sound of a gong releases us Step off before the minute is up and land mines blow your legs off Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail the mouth of
which is at least twenty feet high spilling over withthe things that will give us life here in the arena Food containers of water weapons medicine garments fire starters Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn For instance only a
few steps from my feet lays a threefoot square of plastic Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour But there in the mouth I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather If I had the guts to go in and
fight for it against the other twentythree tributes Which I have been instructed not to do Were on a flat open stretch of ground A plain of hardpacked dirt Behind the tributes across from me I can see nothing indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff To my
right lies a lake To my left and back spars piney woods This is where Haymitch would want me to go Immediately I hear his instructions in my head Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water
But its tempting so tempting when I see the bounty waiting there before me And I know that if I dont get it someone else will That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these lifesustaining spoils Something catches my eye There resting on a
mound of blanket rolls is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to be engaged Thats mine I think Its meant for me Im fast I can sprint faster than any ofthe girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races
But this fortyyard length this is what I am built for I know I can get it I know I can reach it first but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there By the time Ive scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons others
will have reached the horn and one or two I might be able to pick off but say theres a dozen at that close range they could take me down with the spears and the clubs Or their own powerful fists Still I wont be the only target Im betting
many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even one who scored an eleven in training to take out their more fierce adversaries Haymitch has never seen me run Maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it Get the weapon Since thats the very
weapon that might be my salvation And I only see one bow in that whole pile I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run not away into the stir rounding forests
but toward the pile toward the bow When suddenly I notice Peeta hes about five tributes to my right quite a fair distance still I can tell hes looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head But the suns in my eyes and while Im puzzling
over it the gong rings out And Ive missed it Ive missed my chance Because those extra couple of seconds Ive lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in Myfeet shuffle for a moment confused at the direction my brain wants to take and
then I lunge forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread The pickings are so small and Im so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I cant stand leaving
with virtually nothing A boy I think from District 9 reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs splattering my face with blood I stagger back repulsed by the warm sticky spray Then the boy

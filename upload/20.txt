hes
had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as Ive ever seen him He doesnt refuse the offer of wine but when he starts in on his soup I realize its the first time Ive ever seen him eat Maybe he really will pull himself
together long enough to help us Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie At least theyre addressing each other decently And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act While they make small talk I concentrate on the meal Mushroom soup
bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper noodles in a green sauce cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes The servers all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine move wordlessly
to and from the table keeping the platters and glasses full About halfway through my glass of wine my head starts feeling foggy so I change to water instead I dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon How Haymitch can stand walking around like this fulltime is
a mystery I try to focus on the talk which has turned to our interview costumes when a girl sets a gorgeouslooking cake on the table and deftly lights it It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out I have a
moment of doubt What makes it burn Is it alcohol I say looking up at the girl Thats the last thing I wa oh I know you I cant place a name or time to the girls face But Im certain of it The dark red hair the striking features
the porcelain white skin But even as I utter the words I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her and while I cant pull it up I know some bad memory is associated with her The expression of terror that crosses her face only
adds to my confusion and unease She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table When I look back the four adults are watching me like hawks Dont be ridiculous Katniss How could you possibly know an Avox snaps Effie The very thought Whats an Avox
I ask stupidly Someone who committed a crime They cut her tongue so she cant speak says Haymitch Shes probably a traitor of some sort Not likely youd know her And even if you did youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order says
Effie Of course you dont really know her But I do know her And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where Thedisapproval is so high I could never admit it No I guess not I just I stammer and the wine is not helping Peeta
snaps his fingers Delly Cartwright Thats who it is I kept thinking she looked familiar as well Then I realized shes a dead ringer for Delly Delly Cartwright is a pastyfaced lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly
She may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school even me I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile But I jump on Peetas suggestion gratefully Of course thats who I was thinking of It must be the hair
I say Something about the eyes too says Peeta The energy at the table relaxes Oh well If thats all it is says Cinna And yes the cake has spirits but all the alcohol has burned off I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut We eat the
cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast A few of the other couples make a nice impression but none of them can hold a candle to us Even our own party lets out an Ahh as they show us
coming out of the Remake Center Whose idea was the hand holding asks Haymitch Cinnas says Portia Just the perfect touch of rebellion says Haymitch Very nice Rebellion I have to think about that one a moment But when I remember the other couples standing stiffly apart never touching or
acknowledging each other as if their fellow tribute did not exist as if the Games had already begun I know what Haymitch means Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes Tomorrow morning is the first training session Meet me for
breakfast and Ill tell you exactly how I want you to play it says Haymitch to Peeta and I Now go get some sleep while the grownups talk Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms When we get to my door he leans against the frame
not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him So Delly CartwrightImagine finding her lookalike here Hes asking for an explanation and Im tempted to give him one We both know he covered for me So here I am in his debt again If I tell him
the truth about the girl somehow that might even things up How can it hurt really Even if he repeated the story it couldnt do me much harm It was just something I witnessed And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright I realize I do want
to talk to someone about the girl Someone who might be able tohelp me figure out her story Gale would be my first choice but its unlikely Ill ever see Gale again I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me but I

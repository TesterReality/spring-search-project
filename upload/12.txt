Prim being called me running forward tovolunteer You cant miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me as if Im afraid no one will hear and theyll take Prim away But of course they do hear I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself
mount the stage The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud The silent salute One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming As if on cue Haymitch falls off the stage and they groan
comically Peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place We shake hands They cut to the anthem again and the program ends Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation A lot about televised behavior Peeta
unexpectedly laughs He was drunk says Peeta Hes drunk every year Every day I add I cant help smirking a little Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her Yes hisses Effie Trinket How odd you
two find it amusing You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games The one who advises you lines up your sponsors and dictates the presentation of any gifts Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death Just thenHaymitch staggers into the
compartment I miss supper he says in a slurred voice Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess So laugh away says Effie Trinket She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room4For a few moments Peeta and I
take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up We exchange a glance Obviously Haymitch isnt much but Effie Trinket is right about one thing once were in
the arena hes all weve got As if by some unspoken agreement Peeta and I each take one of Haymitchs arms and help him to his feet I tripped Haymitch asks Smells bad He wipes his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit Lets get you back to
your room says Peeta Clean you up a bit We halflead halfcarry Haymitch back to his compartment Since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread we haul him into the bathtuband turn the shower on him He hardly notices Its okay Peeta says to me Ill take
it from here I canthelp feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch wash the vomit out of his chest hair and tuck him into bed Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to be his favorite once
the Games begin But judging by the state hes in Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow All right I say I can send one of the Capitol people to help you Theres any number on the train Cooking for us Waiting on us Guarding us Taking care of
us is their job No I dont want them says Peeta I nod and head to my own room I understand how Peeta feels I cant stand the sight of the Capitol people myself But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge So Im pondering
the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think Its because hes being kind Just as he was kind to give me the bread The idea pulls me up short A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an
unkind one Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there And I cant let Peeta do thisNot where were going So I decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son When I get back to
my room the train is pausing at a platform to refuel I quickly open the window toss the cookies Peetas father gave me out of the train and slam the glass shut No more No more of either of them Unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts
open in a patch of dandelions by the track I only see the image for a moment because the train is off again but its enough Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago    I had just turned away from Peeta
Mellarks bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasnt lost I plucked it carefully and hurried home I grabbed a bucket and Prims hand and headed to the Meadow and yes it was dotted with the goldenheaded weeds After wed harvested those we scrounged along inside
the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens stems and flowers That night we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread What else Prim asked me What other food can we find All kinds of things I promised
her I just have to remember them My mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop The pages weremade of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants Neat handwritten blocks told their names where to gather them when they came in bloom their medical
uses But my father added other entries to the book Plants for eating not healing Dandelions pokeweed wild onions pines Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages The next day we were off school For a while I hung around the edges of

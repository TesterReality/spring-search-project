areas
marked off by ages theoldest in the front the young ones like Prim toward the back Family members line up around the perimeter holding tightly to one anothers hands But there are others too who have no one they love at stake or who no longer care who slip among
the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn Odds aregiven on their ages whether theyre Seam or merchant if they will break down and weep Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully carefully These same people tend to be informers and who hasnt broken
the law I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of those in charge protect me Not everyone can claim the same Anyway Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the bullet
would be much quicker The space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people arrive The squares quite large but not enough to hold District 12s population of about eight thousand Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the
state I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building It holds three chairs a podium and two large glass balls one for the boys and
one for the girls I stare at the paper slips in the girls ball Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting Two of the three chairs fill with Madges father Mayor Undersee whos a tall balding man and Effie Trinket District 12s escort fresh from
the Capitol with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring green suit They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat Just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read Its the same story every
year He tells of the history of Panem the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America He lists the disasters the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land the brutal war
for what little sustenance remained The result was Panem a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens Then came the Dark Days the uprising of the districts against the Capitol Twelve were defeated the thirteenth obliterated The Treaty of Treason gave us the
new laws to guarantee peace and as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated it gave us the Hunger Games The rules of the Hunger Games are simple In punishment for the uprising each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called
tributes to participate The twentyfour tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland Over a period of several weeks the competitors must fight to the deathThe last tribute standing wins Taking the kids from our districts forcing
them to kill one another while we watch this is the Capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion Whatever words they use the real message is clear Look how we take your children and sacrifice
them and theres nothing you can do If you lift a finger we will destroy every last one of you Just as we did in District Thirteen To make it humiliating as well as torturous the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity a sporting event
pitting every district against the others The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home and their district will be showered with prizes largely consisting of food All year the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the
rest of us battle starvation It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks intones the mayor Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors In seventyfour years we have had exactly two Only one is still alive Haymitch Abernathy a paunchy middleaged man who
at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair Hes drunk Very The crowd responds with its token applause but hes confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug which she barely manages to fend off The mayor looks distressed
Since all of this is being televised right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem and he knows it He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket Bright and bubbly as ever Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature
Happy Hunger Games And may the odds be ever in your favor Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly offcenter since her encounter with Haymitch She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here although everyone knows shes just
aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation Through the crowd I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile As reapings go this one at least has a
slight entertainment factor But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his fortytwo names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor Not compared to a lot of the boys And maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens

several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree He must have been watching me the whole time He was only fourteen but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me Id seen him around the Seam and at school And one other time Hed
lost his father in the same blast that killed mine In January Id stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building another oldest child with no father I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just
days away from giving birth Whats your name he said coming over anddisengaging the rabbit from the snare He had another three hanging from his belt Katniss I said barely audible Well Catnip stealings punishable by death or hadnt you heard he said Katniss I said louder And I wasnt
stealing it I just wanted to look at your snare Mine never catch anything He scowled at me not convinced So whered you get the squirrel I shot it I pulled my bow off my shoulder I was still using the small version my father had made me but Id
been practicing with the fullsize one when I could I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game Gales eyes fastened on the bow Can I see that I handed it over Just remember stealings punishable by death That was the first time
I ever saw him smile It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew But it took several months before I returned that smile We talked hunting then I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade Not
food I wanted knowledge I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day He agreed something might be worked out As the seasons went by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our weapons our secret places that were thick with wild
plums or turkeys He taught me snares and fishing I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows And then one day without either of us saying it we became a team Dividing the work and the spoils Making sure that both our
families had food Gale gave me a sense of security Id lacked since my fathers death His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods I became a much better hunter when I didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly when someone was watching my back But he
turned into so much more than a hunting partner He became my confidante someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence In exchange he trusted me with his Being out in the woods with Gale    Sometimes I was actually happy I
call him my friend but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me A pang of longing shoots through my chest If only he was with me now But of course I dont want that I dont want him in the arena
where hed be dead in a few days I just    I just miss him And I hate being so alone Does he miss me He must I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night I know exactly what hed say tome Well theres some
room for improvement there And then hed give me a smile and Id return it without hesitating now I cant help comparing what I have with Gale to what Im pretending to have with Peeta How I never question Gales motives while I do nothing but doubt the latters Its
not a fair comparison really Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive Peeta and I know the others survival means our own death How do you sidestep that Effies knocking at the door reminding me theres another big big big day ahead Tomorrow night will
be our televised interviews I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that I get up and take a quick shower being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit and head down to the dining room Peeta Effie and Haymitch are huddled around
the table talking in hushed voices That seems odd but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them The stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today Perfect on the bed of wild rice Ive shoveled about halfway
through the mound when I realize no ones talking I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth So whats going on Youre coaching us on interviews today right Thats right says Haymitch You dont have to wait until Im done I can listen and cat at
the same time I say Well theres been a change of plans About our current approach says Haymitch Whats that I ask Im not sure what our current approach is Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember Haymitch shrugs
Peeta has asked to be coachedseparately9BetrayalThats the first thing I feel which is ludicrous For there to be betrayal there would have had to been trust first Between Peeta and me And trust has not been part of the agreement Were tributes But the boy who risked a beating to
give me bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who covered for me with theredheaded Avox girl who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills    Was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him On the other hand Im relieved that we can

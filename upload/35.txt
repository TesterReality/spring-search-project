all
a big show Its all how youre perceived The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough although that in itself was a small miracle Now I can say youre a heartbreaker Oh oh oh how the boys back home fall longingly at
your feet Which do you think will get you more sponsors The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick I shove his hands off my shoulders and step away trying to clear my head Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me Hes right Katniss I dont
know what to think I should have been told so I didnt look so stupid No your reaction was perfect If youd known it wouldnt have read as real says Portia Shes just worried about her boyfriend says Peeta gruffly tossing away a bloody piece of the urn My cheeks
burn again at the thought of Gale I dont have a boyfriend Whatever says Peeta But I bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it Besides you didnt say you loved me So what does it matter The words are sinking in My anger fading Im
torn now between thinking Ive been used and thinking Ive been given anedge Haymitch is right I survived my interview but what was I really A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress Giggling The only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about Prim Compare that
with Thresh his silent deadly power and Im forgettable Silly and sparkly and forgettable No not entirely forgettable I have my eleven in training But now Peeta has made me an object of love Not just his To hear him tell it I have many admirers And if the audience
really thinks were in love    I remember how strongly they responded to his confession Starcrossed lovers Haymitch is right they eat that stuff up in the Capitol Suddenly Im worried that I didnt react properly After he said he loved me did you think I could be
in love with him too I ask I did says Portia The way you avoided looking at the cameras the blush They others chime in agreeing Youre golden sweetheart Youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block says Haymitch Im embarrassed about my reaction I force myself to
acknowledge Peeta Im sorry I shoved you Doesnt matter he shrugs Although its technically illegal Are your hands okay I ask Theyll be all right he says In the silence that follows delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room Come on lets eat says Haymitch We
all follow him to the table andtake our places But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily and Portialeads him off for medical treatment We start the cream and rosepetal soup without them By the time weve finished theyre back Peetas hands are wrapped in bandages I cant help feeling guilty
Tomorrow we will be in the arena He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury Will I never stop owing him After dinner we watch the replay in the sitting room I seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my dress although the others
assure me I am charming Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love And there I am blushing and confused made beautiful by Cinnas hands desirable by Peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by all accounts unforgettable When the anthem finishes and the screen goes
dark a hush falls on the room Tomorrow at dawn we will be roused and prepared for the arena The actual Games dont start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late But Peeta and I must make an early start There is no telling how far
we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years Games I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us As soon as they leavehere theyll be at the Games Headquarters hopefully madly signing up our sponsors working out a strategy on how and when
to deliver the gifts to us Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena Still final goodbyes must be said here Effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual tears in her eyes wishes us
well Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor And then because its Effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful she adds I wouldnt be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year
Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over Any final words of advice asks Peeta When the gong sounds get the hell out of there
Youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water he says Got it And after that I ask Stay alive says Haymitch Its the same advice
he gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing this time And we only nod What else is there to say When I head to my room Peeta lingers totalk to Portia Im glad Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow My covers
are drawn back but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl I wish I knew her name I should have asked it She could write it down maybe Or act it out But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her I take a shower and

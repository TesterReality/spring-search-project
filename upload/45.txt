the
pond lilies to make a nice meal I snuggle down in my sleeping bag hanging on to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is A few hours laterthe stampede of feet shakes me from slumber I look around in bewilderment Its not yet dawn but my
stinging eyes can see it It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me13My first impulse is to scramble from the tree but Im belted in Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap still snarled in my
sleeping bag Theres no time for any kind of packing Fortunately my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag I shove in the belt hoist the bag over my shoulder and flee The world has transformed to flame and smoke Burning branches crack from trees and fall in
showers of sparks at my feet All I can do is follow the others the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine But they are much faster flying through
the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs that theres no way I can keep apace with them The heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any moment I pull the top of my
shirt up over my nose grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin veil of protection And I run choking my bag banging against my back my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning because I know I am supposed to
run This was no tributes campfire gone out of control no accidental occurrence The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height a uniformity that marks them as humanmade machinemade Gamemakermade Things have been too quiet today No deaths perhaps no fights at all The audience in the
Capitol will be getting bored claiming that these Games are verging on dullness This is the one thing the Games must not do Its not hard to follow the Gamemakers motivation There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us probably spread far and thin across
the arena This fire is designed to flush us out to drive us together It may not be the most original device Ive seen but its very very effective I hurdle over a burning log Not high enough The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have
to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames But I dont dare leave the jacket scorched andsmoldering as it is I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag hoping the lack of air will quell what I havent extinguished This is all
I have what I carry on my back and its little enough to survive with In a matter of minutes my throat and nose are burning The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked Discomfort turns to distress until each
breath sends a searing pain through my chest I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach Crouching on my hands and knees I retch until theres nothing left to come
up I know I need to keep moving but Im trembling and lightheaded now gasping for air I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle You get one minute I tell myself One minute to rest
I take the time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag and messily stuff everything into the backpack My minutes up I know its time to move on but the smoke has clouded my thoughts The swiftfooted animals that were my compass have left me behind I know
I havent been in this part of the woods before there were no sizable rocks like the one Im sheltering against on my earlier travelsWhere are the Gamemakers driving me Back to the lake To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers I had just found a few hours
of peace at the pond when this attack began Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least The wall of fire must have anend and it wont burn indefinitely Not because the Gamemakers
couldnt keep it fueled but because again that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience If I could get back behind the fire line I could avoid meeting up with the Careers Ive just decided to try and loop back around although it will require miles of travel away
from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head I spring out from under my ledge energized by renewed fear The game has taken a twist The fire was just to get us moving now
the audience will get to see some real fun When I hear the next hiss I flatten on the ground not taking time to look The fireball hits a tree off to my left engulfing it in flames To remain still is death Im barely on my feet before the
third ball hits the ground where I was lying sending a pillar of fire up behind me Timeloses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks I cant see where theyre being launched from but its not a hovercraft The angles are not extreme enough Probably this

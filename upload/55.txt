against
me and falls asleep Nor do I have any misgivings about her as I take no particular precautions If shed wanted me dead all shewould have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest Needling me at the very back of my mind
is the obvious Both of us cant win these Games But since the odds are still against either of us surviving I manage to ignore the thought Besides Im distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy
their food Im pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle Traditionally the Career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there The years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another
a Gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage because they dont know how to be hungry Not the way Rue and I do But Im too
exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight My wounds recovering my mind still a bit foggy from the venom and the warmth of Rue at my side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me a sense of security I realize for the first time how very lonely Ive
been in the arena How comforting the presence of another human being can be I give in to my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn Tomorrow its the Careers who will have to watch their backs The boom of the cannon jolts me awakeThe skys streaked with light
the birds already chattering Rue perches in a branch across from me her hands cupping something We wait listening for more shots but there arent any Who do you think that was I cant help thinking of Peeta I dont know It could have been any of the others says
Rue I guess well know tonight Whos left again I ask The boy from District One Both tributes from Two The boy from Three Thresh and me And you and Peeta says Rue Thats eight Wait and the boy from Ten the one with the bad leg He makes nine
Theres someone else but neither of us can remember who it is I wonder how that last one died says Rue No telling But its good for us A death should hold the crowd for a bit Maybe well have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have
been moving too slowly I say Whats in your hands Breakfast says Rue She holds them out revealing two big eggs What kind are those I ask Not sure Theres a marshy area over that way Some kind of waterbird she says Itd be nice to cook them but neither
of us wants to risk a fire My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the Games We each suck out the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and some berries Its a
good breakfast anywhere Ready to do it I say pulling on my pack Do what says Rue but by the way she bounces up you can tell shes up for whatever I propose Today we take out the Careers food I say ReallyHow You can see the glint of excitement
in her eyes In this way shes exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal No idea Come on well figure out a plan while we hunt I say We dont get much hunting done though because Im too busy getting every scrap of information I can
out of Rue about the Careers base Shes only been in to spy on them briefly but shes observant They have set up their camp beside the lake Their supply stash is about thirty yards away During the day theyve been leaving another tribute the boy from District 3 to
watch over the supplies The boy from District Three I ask Hes working with them Yes he stays at the camp fulltime He got stung too when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake says Rue I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as
their guard But hes not very big What weapons does he have I ask Not much that I could see A spear He might be able to hold a few of us off with that but Thresh could killhim easily says Rue And the foods just out in the open
I say She nods Somethings not quite right about that whole setup I know But I couldnt tell what exactly says Rue Katniss even if you could get to the food how would you get rid of it Burn it Dump it in the lake Soak it in fuel I
poke Rue in the belly just like I would Prim Eat it She giggles Dont worry Ill think of something Destroying things is much easier than making them For a while we dig roots we gather berries and greens we devise a strategy in hushed voices And I come to
know Rue the oldest of six kids fiercely protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the younger ones who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours Rue who when you ask her what she loves most in the world
replies of all things Music Music I say In our world I rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather You have a lot of time for that We sing at home At work

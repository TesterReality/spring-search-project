a
tree My shoulders relax and I grin She can move through the woods like a shadow you have to give her that How else could she have followed me The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them You know theyre not the only ones who can
form alliances I say For a moment no response Then one of Rues eyes edges around the trunk You want me for an ally Why not You saved me with those tracker jackers Youre smart enough to still be alive And I cant seem to shake you anyway I say
She blinks at metrying to decide You hungry I can see her swallow hard her eye flickering to the meat Come on then Ive had two kills today Rue tentatively steps out into the open I can fix your stings Can you I ask How She digs in the pack
she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves Im almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses Whered you find those Just around We all carry them when we work in the orchards They left a lot of nests there says Rue There are a lot here too Thats
right Youre District Eleven Agriculture I say Orchards huh That must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings Rue smiles Ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in Well come on then Fix me up I plunk down by the fire
and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee To my surprise Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chewthem My mother would use other methods but its not like we have a lot of options After a minute or so
Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee Ohhh The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it Its as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting Rue gives a giggleLucky you had the sense
to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse Do my neck Do my cheek I almost beg Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth and soon Im laughing because the relief is so sweet I notice a long burn on Rues forearm Ive got something
for that I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine You have good sponsors she says longingly Have you gotten anything yet I ask She shakes her head You will though Watch The closer we get to the end the more people will realize how
clever you are I turn the meat over You werent joking about wanting me for an ally she asks No I meant it I say I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child But I want her Because shes a survivor and I trust
her and why not admit it She reminds me of Prim Okay she says and holds out her hand We shake Its a deal Of course this kind of deal can only be temporary but neither of us mentions that Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy
root to the meal Roasted over the fire they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip She recognizes the bird too some wild thing they call a groosling in her district She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day
For a while all conversation stops aswe fill our stomachs The groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite into it Oh says Rue with a sigh Ive never had a whole leg to myself before Ill bet she hasnt Ill bet
meat hardly ever comes her way Take the other I say Really she asks Take whatever you want Now that Ive got a bow and arrows I can get more Plus Ive got snares I can show you how to set them I say Rue still looks uncertainly at the
leg Oh take it I say putting the drumstick in her hands It will only keep a few days anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit Once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful Id have thought in District
Eleven youd have a bit more to eat than us You know since you grow the food I say Rues eyes widen Oh no were not allowed to eat the crops They arrest you or something I ask They whip you and make everyone else watch says Rue The mayors
very strict about it I can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence A public whippings a rare thing in District 12 although occasionally one occurs Technically Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well technically we could
get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat Besides ourmayor Madges father doesnt seem to have much taste for such events Maybe being the least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages Such as being largely ignored by the Capitol as long
as we produce our coal quotas Do you get all the coal you want Rue asks No I answer Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots They feed us a bit extra during harvest so that people can keep going longer says Rue Dont you
have to be in school I ask Not during harvest Everyone works then says Rue Its interesting hearing about her life We have so little communication with anyone outside our district In fact I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation because even though the information seems

It
could only be the Capitol But they had everything here No cause to rebel Id leave here Peeta blurtsout Then he looks around nervously It was loud enough to hear above the chimes He laughs Id go home now if they let me But you have to admit the foods
prime Hes covered again If thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol Its getting chilly We better go in he says Inside the dome its warm and bright His tone is conversational Your
friend Gale Hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping Yes Do you know him I ask Not really I hear the girls talk about him a lot I thought he was your cousin or something You favor each other he says No were not related I
say Peeta nods unreadable Did he come to say goodbye to you Yes I say observing him carefully So did your father He brought me cookies Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news But after watching him lie so smoothly I dont give this much weight Really Well
he likes you and your sister I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys The idea that I might ever have been discussed around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in passing in Peetas house gives me a start It must have
been when the mother was out of the room He knew your mother when they were kids says Peeta Another surprise But probably true Oh yes She grew up in town I say It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread Were at
my door I give back his jacket See you in the morning then See you he says and walks off down the hall When I open my door the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower I want
to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier But I remember Im not supposed to speak to her unless Im giving her an order Oh sorry I say I was supposed to get those back to Cinna Im sorry Can you take them to him She avoids my eyes
gives a small nod and heads out the door Id set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner But I know that my apology runs much deeper That Im ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods That I let the Capitol kill the boy and
mutilate her without lifting afinger Just like I was watching the Games I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes The shivering hasnt stopped Perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me But I know she does You dont forget the face of the person who
was your last hope I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak But I can feel her eyes staring at me piercing through walls and doors and bedding I wonder if shell enjoy watching me die7My slumbers
are filled with disturbing dreams The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games with my mother withdrawn and unreachable with Prim emaciated and terrified I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mineexplodes into a million deadly bits of light Dawn
is breaking through the windows The Capitol has a misty haunted air My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood Slowly I drag myself out of bed and into the shower
I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me Then Im deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush Oh well At least my
blood is flowing When Im dried and moisturized with lotion I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet Tight black pants a longsleeved burgundy tunic and leather shoes I put my hair in the single braid down my back This is the first
time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself No fancy hair and clothes no flaming capes Just me Looking like I could be headed for the woods It calms me Haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for breaklast and no one has contacted me
this morning but Im hungry so I head down to the dining room hoping there will be food Im not disappointed While the table is empty a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes A young man an Avox stands at attention by
the spread When I ask if I can serve myself he nods assent I load a plate with eggs sausages batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melonAs I gorge myself I watch the sun rise over the Capitol I have a second plate of hot
grain smothered in beef stew Finally I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate the way Peeta did on the train My mind wanders to my mother and Prim They must be up My mother getting their breakfast
of mush Prim milking her goat before school Just two mornings ago I was home Can that be right Yes just two And now how empty the house feels even from a distance What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games Did it give

Suppose
when you answer the questions you think youre addressing a friend back home Who would your best friend be asks Cinna Gale I say instantly Only it doesnt make sense Cinna I would never be telling Gale those things about me He already knows them What about me Could you
think of me as a friend asks Cinna Of all the people Ive met since I left home Cinna is by far my favorite I liked him right off and he hasnt disappointed me yet I think so but Ill be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists
Youll be able to look right at me When youre asked a question find me and answer it as honestly as possible says Cinna Even if what I think is horrible I ask Because it might be really Especially if what you think is horrible says Cinna Youll try it
I nod Its a plan Or at least a straw to grasp atToo soon its time to go The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of theTraining Center Once I leave my room it will be only minutes until Im in front of the crowd the cameras
all of Panem As Cinna turns the doorknob I stop his hand Cinna    Im completely overcome with stage fright Remember they already love you he says gently Just be yourself We meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the elevator Portia and her
gang have been hard at work Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents While we look well together its a relief not to be dressed identically Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion I avoid Haymitch but accept Effies compliments Effie can be tiresome
and clueless but shes not destructive like Haymitch When the elevator opens the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage All twentyfour of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews Ill be last or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from
each district How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way Now Ill have to listen to how witty funny humble fierce and charming everybodyelse is before I go up Plus the audience will start to get bored just as the Gamemakers did
And I cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention Right before we parade onto the stage Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls Remember youre still a happy pair So act like it What I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for
separate coaching But I guess that was a private not a public thing Anyway theres not much chance for interaction now as we walk singlefile to our seats and take our places Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow I can feel my pulse pounding in
my temples Its a relief to get to my chair because between the heels and my legs shaking Im afraid Ill trip Although evening is falling the City Circle is brighter than a summers day An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests with the stylists commanding
the front row The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies But the City Circle and the avenues that feed
into it are completely packed with people Standing room only At homes and community halls around the country every television set is turned on Every citizen of Panem is tuned in There will be no blackouts tonight Caesar Flickerman the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty
years bounces onto the stage Its a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time Same face under a coating of pure white makeup Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games Same ceremonial suit midnight blue dotted with a thousand
tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars They do surgery in the Capitol to make people appearyounger and thinner In District 12 looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity ask the
secret of survival A plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us But here it is different Wrinkles arent desirable A round belly isnt a sign of success This year Caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the
same hue He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to bebleeding Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business The girl tribute from District 1 looking provocative in a seethrough
gold gown steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview You can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her With that flowing blonde hair emerald green eyes her body tall and lush    Shes sexy all
the way Each interview only lasts three minutes Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up Ill say this for Caesar he really does his best to make the tributes shine Hes friendly tries to set the nervous ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can
turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts I sit like a lady the way Effie showed me as the districts slip by 2 3 4 Everyone seems to be playing up some angle The monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing

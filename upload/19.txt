a
little shaky there says Peeta It didnt show I tell him Im sure no one noticed Im sure they didnt notice anything but you You should wear flames more often he says They suit you And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the
right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me A warning bell goes off in my head Dont be so stupid Peeta is planning how to kill you I remind myself He is luring you in to make you easy prey The more likable he is the more deadly
he is But because two can play at this game I stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek Right on his bruise6The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams This will be our home until the actual Games begin Each district has an entire
floor You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district Easy enough to remember Ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12 Once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final
goodbyes to my friends andfamily But thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into
the air Its exhilarating and Im tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seems childish Apparently Effie Trinkets duties did not conclude at the station She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena In a way thats a plus because
at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train Probably passed out somewhere Effie Trinket on the other hand seems to be flying high Were the first team shes ever
chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies Shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves And to hear her tell it Effie knows everyone whos anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day trying to win us sponsors Ive been
very mysterious though she says her eyes squint half shut Because of course Haymitch hasnt bothered totell me your strategies But Ive done my best with what I had to work with How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your
district Barbarism Thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter And whats she basing our success on Our table manners Everyone has their reservations naturally You being from the coal district But I said and this was very clever of me I said Well if you
put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong Coal doesnt turn to pearls They grow in shellfish Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds but thats untrue
too Ive heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds But we dont mine graphite in District 12 That was part of District 13s job until they were destroyed I wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either
know or care Unfortunately I cant seal the sponsor deals for you Only Haymitch can do that says Effie grimly But dont worry Ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary Although lacking in many departments Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire My quarters
are larger than our entire house back home They are plush like the train car but also have so many automatic gadgets that Im sure I wont have time to press all the buttons The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating
water temperature pressure soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging sponges When you step out on a mat heaters come on that blowdry your body Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair I merely place my hand on a box that sendsa current through my scalp untangling parting
and drying my hair almost instantly It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain I program the closet for an outfit to my taste The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command You need only whisper a type of food from a
gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears hot and steamy before you in less than a minute I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres a knock on the door Effies calling me to dinner Good Im starving Peeta Cinna and Portia are standing
out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room Im gladto see the stylists particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster Besides dinner isnt really about food
its about planning out our strategies and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine I think about turning it down but Ive never had wine except the homemade stuff my mother
uses for coughs and when will I get a chance to try it again I take a sip of the tart dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served It looks as if

stop
the pretense of being friends Obviously whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed And high time too The Games begin in two days and trust will only be a weakness Whatever triggered Peetas decision and I suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training I
should be nothing but grateful for it Maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies the better Good I say So whats the schedule Youll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content says Haymitch You
start with Effie Katniss I cant imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours but shes got me working down to the last minute We go to my rooms and she puts me in a fulllength gown and highheeled shoes not the ones Ill he
wearing for the actual interview and instructs me on walking The shoes are the worst part Ive never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet But Effie runs around in them fulltime and Im determined that if she can do
it so can I The dress poses anotherproblem It keeps tangling around my shoes so of course I hitch it up and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands and yelling Not above the ankle When I finally conquer walking theres still sitting posture apparently
I have a tendency to duck my head eye contact hand gestures and smiling Smiling is mostly about smiling more Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while smiling or ending with a smile By lunch the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse
Well thats the best I can do Effie says with a sigh Just remember Katniss you want the audience to like you And you dont think they will I ask Not if you glare at them the entire time Why dont you save that for the arena Instead think of
yourself among friends says Effie Theyre betting on how long Ill live I burst out Theyre not my friends Well try and pretend snaps Effie Then she composes herself and beams at me See like this Im smiling at you even though youre aggravating me Yes it feels very convincing
I say Im going to eat 1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room hiking my skirt up to my thighs Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods so Im thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning I couldnt be more
wrong After lunchHaymitch takes me into thesitting room directs me to the couch and then just frowns at me for a while What I finally ask Im trying to figure out what to do with you he says How were going to present you Are you going to be charming
Aloof Fierce So far youre shining like a star You volunteered to save your sister Cinna made you look unforgettable Youve got the top training score People are intrigued but no one knows who you are The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in
terms of sponsors says Haymitch Having watched the tribute interviews all my life I know theres truth to what hes saying If you appeal to the crowd either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric you gain favor Whats Peetas approach Or am I not allowed to ask I say
Likable He has a sort of selfdeprecating humor naturally says Haymitch Whereas when you open your mouth you come across more as sullen and hostile I do not I say Please I dont know where you pulled that cheery wavy girl on the chariot from but I havent seen her
before or since says Haymitch And youve given me so many reasons to be cheery I counterBut you dont have to please me Im not going to sponsor you So pretend Im the audience says Haymitch Delight me Fine I snarl Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and I
try to answer his questions in a winning fashion But I cant Im too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is the Hunger Games Why am I hopping around like
some trained dog trying to please people I hate The longer the interview goes on the more my fury seems to rise to the surface until Im literally spitting out answers at him All right enough he says Weve got to find another angle Not only are you hostile I
dont know anything about you Ive asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life your family what you care about They want to know about you Katniss But I dont want them to Theyre already taking my future They cant have the things that mattered to
me in the past I say Then lie Make something up says Haymitch Im not good at lying I say Well you better learn fast Youve got about as much charm as a dead slug says Haymitch Ouch That hurts Even Haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his
voice softens Heres an idea Try acting humble Humble I echo That you cant believe a little girl from DistrictTwelve has done this well The whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of Talk about Cinnas clothes How nice the people are How the city amazes you
If you wont talk about yourself at least compliment the audience Just keep turning it back around all right Gush The next hours are agonizing At once its clear I cannot gush We try me playing cocky but I just dont have the arrogance Apparently Im too vulnerable for

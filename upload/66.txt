one
of those And the stream The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond If he stuck to the stream he could change his location and always be near water He could walk in thecurrent and erase any tracks
He might even be able to get a fish or two Well its a place to start anyway To confuse my enemies minds I start a fire with plenty of green wood Even if they think its a ruse I hope theyll decide Im hidden somewhere near it While in
reality Ill be tracking Peeta The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream Im tempted to call out Peetas name as I go but decide
against it I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me But hell know Ill be looking right He wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think Id ignore the new rule and keep to
myself Would he Hes very hard to predict which might be interesting under different circumstances but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle It doesnt take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go the Careers camp Theres been no sign of Peeta but this doesnt
surprise me Ive been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident If he were nearby surely Id have had some suspicion of it The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me Muddy banks covered in
tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until Ibegin to feel somewhat trapped It would be no small matter to escape the stream now Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain In fact Ive just about decided Im on the wrong
track entirely that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder Its long dried now but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully
in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away Hugging the rocks I move slowly in the direction of the blood searching for him I find a few more bloodstains onewith a few threads of fabric glued to it but no sign of life I break down and
say his name in a hushed voice Peeta Peeta Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so I stop I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking He must have moved on Somewhere farther down My foot has just broken
the surface of the water when I hear a voice You here to finish me off sweetheart I whip around Its come from the left so I cant pick it up very well And the voice was hoarse and weak Still it must have been Peeta Who else in the
arena would call mesweetheart My eyes peruse the bank but theres nothing Just mud the plants the base of the rocks Peeta I whisper Where are you Theres no answer Could I just have imagined it No Im certain it was real and very close at hand too Peeta I
creep along the bank Well dont step on me I jump back His voice was right under my feet Still theres nothing Then his eyes open unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs Its
the final word in camouflage Forget chucking weights around Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree Or a boulder Or a muddy bank full of weeds Close your eyes again I order He does and his mouth too and completely
disappears Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible I kneel beside him I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off Peeta smiles Yes frosting The final
defense of the dying Youre not going to die I tell him firmly Says who His voice is so ragged Says me Were on the same team now you know I tell him His eyes open So I heard Nice of you to find whats left of me I pull
out my water bottle and give him a drink Did Cato cut you I ask Left legUp high he answers Lets get you in the stream wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds youve got I say Lean down a minute first he says Need to
tell you something I lean over and put my good ear to his lips which tickle as he whispers Remember were madly in love so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it I jerk my head back but end up laughing Thanks Ill keep it in
mind At least hes still able to joke around But when I start to help him to the stream all the levity disappears Its only two feet away how hard can it be Very hard when I realize hes unable to move an inch on his own Hes so weak
that the best he can do is not to resist I try to drag him but despite the fact that I know hes doing all he can to keep quiet sharp cries of pain escape him The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have

been
eating blackberries only this morning It seems like a lifetime ago Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare Maybe if I go to sleep I will wake up back in District 12 where I belong Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns but I just strip off
my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear The sheets are made of soft silky fabric A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth If Im going to cry now is the time to do it By morning Ill be able to wash the damage done by the
tears from my face But no tears come Im too tired or too numb to cry The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else So I let the train rock me into oblivion Gray light is leaking throughthe curtains when the rapping rouses me I hear
Effie Trinkets voice calling me to rise Up up up Its going to be a big big big day I try and imagine for a moment what it must be like inside thatwomans head What thoughts fill her waking hours What dreams come to her at night I have no
idea I put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I think of the woods and of my father and of my mother and Prim waking
up having to get on with things I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so I just leave it up It doesnt matter We cant be far from the Capitol now And once we reach the city my
stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway I just hope I get one who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion As I enter the dining car Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee Shes muttering obscenities under her breath
Haymitch his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences is chuckling Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassedSit down Sit down says Haymitch waving me over The moment I slide into my chair Im served an enormous platter of food Eggs ham piles of fried potatoes A
tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week Theres an elegant glass of orange juice At least I think its orange juice Ive only even tasted an orange once at New Years
when my father bought one as a special treat A cup of coffee My mother adores coffee which we could almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin to me A rich brown cup of something Ive never seen They call it hot chocolate says Peeta Its good
I take a sip of the hot sweet creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me Even though the rest of the meal beckons I ignore it until Ive drained my cup Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold which is a substantial amount being careful to not
overdo it on the richest stuff One time my mother told me that I always eat like Ill never see food again And I said I wont unless I bring it home That shut her up When my stomach feels like its about to split open I lean back and
take in my breakfast companions Peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate Haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter but hes knockingback a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle Judging by the
fumes its some kind of spirit I dont know Haymitch but Ive seen him often enough in the Hob tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor Hell be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol I realize I detest Haymitch No wonder
the District 12 tributes never stand a chance It isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it But we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why The rich people
who back tributeseither because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with So youre supposed to give us advice I say to Haymitch Heres some advice Stay alive says Haymitch and then bursts out laughing I
exchange a look with Peeta before I remember Im having nothing more to do with him Im surprised to see the hardness in his eyes He generally seems so mild Thats very funny says Peeta Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitchs hand It shatters on the floor
sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train Only not to us Haymitch considers this a moment then punches Peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair When he turns back to reach for the spirits I drive my knife into the table between his hand
and the bottle barely missing his fingers I brace myself to deflect his hit but it doesnt come Instead he sits back and squints at us Well whats this says Haymitch Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a
handful of ice from under the fruit tureen He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw No says Haymitch stopping him Let the bruise show The audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena Thats

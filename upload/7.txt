my
fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam The community home would crush her like a bug So I kept our predicament a secret But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death Theres no
other way to put it I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May just May 8th I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us Only there were still several weeks to
go We could well be dead by then Starvations not an uncommon fate in District 12 Who hasnt seen the victims Older people who cant work Children from a family with too many to feed Those injured in the mines Straggling through the streets And one day you come upon
them sitting motionless against a wall orlying in the Meadow you hear the wails from a house and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body Starvation is never the cause of death officially Its always the flu or exposure or pneumonia But that fools no one On the
afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets I had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prims in the public market but there were no takers Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with
my father I was too frightened to venture into that rough gritty place alone The rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket leaving me chilled to the bone For three days wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves Id found in the back of
a cupboard By the time the market closed I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle I didnt pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet Besides no onewanted those clothes I couldnt go
home Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips I couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches I had scavenged atthe edge of the woods after the coal had run out
my bands empty of any hope I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople The merchants live above their businesses so I was essentially in their backyards I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring a goat
or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunched defeated in the muck All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12 Punishable by death But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game Perhaps a
bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat Unfortunately the bins had just been emptied When I passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming I felt dizzy The ovens were in the back
and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life I lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly
bare Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers andhow sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash The words were ugly
and I had no defense As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away I noticed him a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back Id seen him at school He was in my year but I didnt know his name He stuck with the town
kids so how would I His mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree The realization that Id have nothing to
take home had finally sunk in My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots It was too much I was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home I thought Or better
yet let me die right here in the rain There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and I vaguely wondered what was going on Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought Its her Shes
coming to drive me away with a stick But it wasnt her It was the boy In his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black His mother was yelling Feed it to the pig you stupid
creatureWhy not No one decent will buy burned bread He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts andtoss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer The boy never even glanced my way but I was watching him
Because of the bread because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone What had she hit him with My parents never hit us I couldnt even imagine it The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear then

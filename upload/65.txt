unspoken
rule about not eating one another Under the new rule both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive Claudius pauses as if he knows were not getting it and repeats the change again The news sinks in Two tributes can win
this year If theyre from the same district Both can live Both of us can live Before I can stop myself I call out Peetas namePART IIITHE VICTOR19I clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has already escaped The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of
frogs begin to sing Stupid I tell myself What a stupid thing to do I wait frozen for the woods to come alive with assailants Then I remember theres almost no one left Peeta whos been wounded is now my ally Whatever doubts Ive had about him dissipate because if
either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to District 12 In fact I know if I was watching Id loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner Besides it just makes sense to protect each other And in my case
being one of the starcrossed lovers from District 12 its an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors The starcrossed lovers    Peeta must have been playing that angle all along Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules
For two tributes to have a shot at winning our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games Nothanks to me All Ive done is managed not to kill Peeta But whatever hes donein the arena he must have the
audience convinced it was to keep me alive Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia Fighting Cato to let me escape Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me Peeta it turns out has never been a danger to me
The thought makes me smile I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it So who is there left to be afraid of Foxface The boy tribute from her district is dead Shes operating alone at night And
her strategy has been to evade not attack I dont really think that even if she heard my voice shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me Then theres Thresh All right hes a distinct threat But I havent seen him not once since the Games began I
think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion But she didnt turn to the Woods she turned to whatever lies across from it To that area of the arena that drops off into I dont know what I feel almost certain
that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain Hed never have heard me from there and even if he did Im up too high for someone his size to reach So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2 who are now surely celebrating
the new rule Theyre the onlyones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself Do I run from them now on the chance they heard me call Peetas name No I think Let them come Let them come with their nightvision glasses and their heavy branchbreaking bodies Right into
the range of my arrows But I know they wont If they didnt come in daylight to my fire they wont risk what could be another trap at night When they come it will be on their own terms not because Ive let them know my whereabouts Stay put and
get some sleep Katniss I instruct myself although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now Tomorrow youll find him I do sleep but in the morning Im extracautious thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for
me I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast securing my pack readying my weapons before I descend But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground Today Ill have to be scrupulously careful The Careers will know Im trying to locate Peeta They
may well want to wait until I do before they move in If hes as badly wounded as Cato thinks Id be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance But if hes that incapacitated how has he managed to stay alive And how on earth
will I find him Itry to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but nothing rings a bell So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to run Then
Cato appeared hissword drawn And after I was gone he wounded Peeta But how did Peeta get away Maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape But hed been stung too So how far could he
have gotten stabbed and filled with venom And how has he stayed alive all these days since If the wound and the stingers havent killed him surely thirst would have taken him by now And thats when I get my first clue to his whereabouts He couldnt have survived without
water I know that from my first few days here He must be hidden somewhere near a source Theres the lake but I find that an unlikely option since its so close to the Careers base camp A few springfed pools But youd really be a sitting duck at

scrub
the gold paint the makeup the scent of beauty from my body All that remains of the designteams efforts are the flames on my nails I decide tokeep them as reminder of who I am to the audience Katniss the girl who was on fire Perhaps it will give me
something to hold on to in the days to come I pull on a thick fleecy nightgown and climb into bed It takes me about five seconds to realize Ill never fall asleep And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment I give in to fatigue will
be an invitation to death Its no good One hour two three pass and my eyelids refuse to get heavy I cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain Ill be thrown into Desert Swamp A frigid wasteland Above all I am hoping for trees which may afford me some
means of concealment and food and shelter Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve tooquickly without them But what will the climate be like What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments And then there are my fellow tributes
   The more anxious I am to find sleep the more it eludes me Finally I am too restless to even stay in bed I pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing too short My room feels like a prison cell If I dont get air soon
Im going to start to throw things again I run down the hall to the door to the roof Its not only unlocked but ajar Perhaps someone forgot to close it but it doesnt matter The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape And Im not
looking to escape only to fill my lungs with air I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me The roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface I see
his silhouette black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol Theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets music and singing and car horns none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room I could slip away now without him
noticing me he wouldnt hear me over the din But the night airs so sweet I cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room And what difference does it make Whether we speak ornot My feet move soundlessly across the tiles Im only yard behind him when I
say You should be getting some sleep He starts but doesnt turn I can see him give his head a slight shake I didnt want to miss the party Its for us after all I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail The wide streets
are full of dancing people I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail Are they in costumes Who could tell Peeta answers With all the crazy clothes they wear here Couldnt sleep either Couldnt turn my mind off I say Thinking about your family he asks No
I admit a bit guiltily All I can do is wonder about tomorrow Which is pointless of course In the light from below I can see his face now the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands I really am sorry about your hands It doesnt matter Katniss he says
Ive never been a contender in theseGames anyway Thats no way to be thinking I say Why not Its true My best hope is to not disgrace myself and    He hesitates And what I say I dont know how to say it exactly Only   
I want to die as myself Does that make any sense he asks I shake my head How could he die as anyone but himself I dont want them to changeme in there Turn me into some kind of monster that Im not I bite my lip feeling inferior While
Ive been ruminating on the availability of trees Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity His purity of self Do you mean you wont kill anyone I ask No when the time comes Im sure Ill kill just like everybody else I cant go down without a
fight Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capitol they dont own me That Im more than just a piece in their Games says Peeta But youre not I say None of us are Thats how the Games work Okay
but within that framework theres still you theres still me he insists Dont you see A little Only    No offense but who cares Peeta I say I do I mean what else am I allowed to care about at this point he asks angrily Hes locked those
blue eyes on mine now demanding an answer I take a step back Care about what Haymitch said About staying alive Peeta smiles at me sad and mocking Okay Thanks for the tip sweetheart Its like a slap in the face His use of Haymitchs patronizing endearment Look if you
want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena thats your choice I want to spend mine in District Twelve Wouldnt surprise me if you do says Peeta Give my mother my best when you make it back will youCount on it I
say Then I turn and leave the roof I spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze imagining the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning Peeta Mellark We will see how high and mighty he is when hes faced

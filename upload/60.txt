my
sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue I was supposed to pick up another one but what with the mines and all I forgot I begin to shiver Since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover
myself with leaves and pine needles Im still freezing I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind Its a little better I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night
But now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning More leaves more pine needles I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest Somehow I drift off to sleep When I open my eyes the world looks
slightly fractured and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision As I sit up and remove them I hear a laugh somewhere nearthe lake and freeze The laughs distorted but the fact that it registered at all means
I must be regaining my hearing Yes my right ear can hear again although its still ringing As for my left ear well at least the bleeding has stopped I peer through the bushes afraid the Careers have returned trapping me here for an indefinite time No its Foxface standing
in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing Shes smarter than the Careers actually finding a few useful items in the ashes A metal pot A knife blade Im perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers stores eliminated she might actually stand a chance Just like
the rest of us It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack But I rule it out Theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back With that
in mind this might be an excellent time to shoot her But shes heard something not me because her head turns away toward the dropoff and she sprints for the woods I wait No one nothing shows up Still if Foxface thought it was dangerous maybe its time for me
to get out of here too Besides Im eager to tell Rue about the pyramid Since Ive no idea where the Careers are the route back by the stream seems as good as any Ihurry loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in the other because Im
famished now and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat The trip to the stream is uneventful Once there I refill my water and wash taking particular care with my injured ear Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide
At one point I find boot prints in the mud along the bank The Careers have been here but not for a while The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun I havent been careful enough about my
own tracks counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body my spirits I shoot two fish easy pickings
in this slowmoving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even though Ive just had the groosling The second Ill save for Rue Gradually subtly the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically trying to clean away
whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds If theres improvement its undetectable I cant adjust to deafness in the ear It makes me feel offbalanced and defenseless to my left Blind even My head keeps turning tothe injured side as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of
nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information The more time that passes the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal When I reach the site of our first meeting I feel certain its beenundisturbed Theres no sign of Rue not on the
ground or in the trees This is odd By now she should have returned as its midday Undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree somewhere What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their nightvision glasses tramping around the woods And the third fire she
was supposed to set although I forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all Shes probably just being cautious about making her way back I wish shed hurry because I dont want to hang around here too long I want to spend the
afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we go But theres nothing really for me to do but wait I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my evergrowing list of wounds The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them
anyway The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection I go ahead andeat the second fish It isnt going to last long in this hot sun but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue If she would just show up Feeling too
vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing I scale a tree to wait If the Careers show up this will be a fine place to shoot them from The sun moves slowly I do things to pass the time Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that

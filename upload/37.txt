with
life and death Hell probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat someones heart after theyve killed them There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have
him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players hed killed before he ate them There are no rules in the arena but cannibalism doesnt play well with the Capitol audience so they tried to head it off There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally
took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic I dont see Peeta in the morning Cinna comes to me before dawn gives me a simple shift to wear and guides me to the roof My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the
catacombs under the arena itself A hovercraft appears out of thin air just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured and a ladder drops down I place my hands and feet on the lowerrungs and instantly its as if Im frozen
Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while Im lifted safely inside I expect the ladder to release me then but Im still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe This is just your tracker Katniss The stiller you are the more
efficiently I can place it  she says Still Im a statue But that doesnt prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm Now the Gamemakers will always be able to
trace my whereabouts in the arena Wouldnt want to lose a tribute As soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases me The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out
Despite the tension in my stomach I eat as much as I can although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me Im so nervous I could be eating coal dust The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail
over the city and then to the wilderness beyond This is what birds see Only theyre free and safe The very opposite of me The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out suggesting that were nearing the arena The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go
backto the ladder only this time it leads down into a tube underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena We follow instructions to my destination a chamber for my preparation In the Capitol they call it the Launch Room In the districts its referred to as the Stockyard
The place animals go before slaughter Everything is brandnew I will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room The arenas are historic sites preserved after the Games Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit to vacation Go for a month rewatch the Games tour the catacombs
visit the sites where the deaths took place You can even take part in reenactments They say the food is excellent I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back Then the clothes
arrive the same for every tribute Cinna has had no say in my outfit does not even know what will be in the package but he helps me dress in the undergarments simple tawny pants light green blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black jacket that falls to my
thighs The material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat Expect some cool nights he says The boots worn over skintight socks are better than I could have hoped for Soft leather not unlike my ones athome These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though Good for
running I think Im finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket I had completely forgotten about it Where did you get that I ask Off the green outfit you wore on the train he says I remember nowtaking it off my mothers dress pinning it to
the shirt Its your district token right I nod and he fastens it on my shirt It barely cleared the review board Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage But eventually they let it through says Cinna They eliminated a ring from
that District One girl though If you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out Poisoned one She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did But she lost her token There youre all set Move around Make sure everything feels comfortable
I walk run in a circle swing my arms about Yes its fine Fits perfectly Then theres nothing to do but wait for the call says Cinna Unless you think you could eat any more I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips
of as we wait on a couch I dont want to chew on my nails or lips so Ifind myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek It still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth Nervousness seeps into terror as
I anticipate what is to come I could be dead flatout dead in an hour Not even My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device I press on it even though it hurts I press on it so hard

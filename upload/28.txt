I
really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me Well thats that says Haymitch Then he butters a roll Do you think theyll arrest me I ask Doubt it Be a pain to replace you at this stage says Haymitch What about
my family I say Will they punish them Dont think so Wouldnt make much sense See theyd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population People would need to know what you did But they cant since its secret
so itd be a waste of effort says Haymitch More likely theyll make your life hell in the arena Well theyve already promised to do that to us any way says Peeta Very true says Haymitch And I realize the impossible has happened They have actually cheered me up Haymitch
picks up a pork chop with his fingers which makes Effie frown and dunks it in his wine He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckleWhat were their faces like I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up Shocked Terrified Uh ridiculous some of them
An image pops into my mind One man trippedbackward into a bowl of punch Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie although even she is suppressing a smile Well it serves them right Its their job to pay attention to you And just because you come from District
Twelve is no excuse to ignore you Then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous Im sorry but thats what I think she says to no one in particular Ill get a very bad score I say Scores only matter if theyre very good no one
pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones For all they know you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose People use that strategy said Portia I hope thats how people interpret the four Ill probably get says Peeta If that Really is anything
less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards One almost landed on my foot I grin at him and realize that Im starving I cut off a piece of pork dunk it in mashed potatoes and start eating Its okay
My family is safe And if they are safe no real harm has been done After dinner we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television First they show a photo of the tribute then flash their score below it The Career Tributes naturally get in the
eighttoten range Most of the other players average a five Surprisingly little Rue comes up with a seven I dont know what she showed the judges but shes so tiny it must have been impressive District 12 comes up last as usual Peeta pulls an eight so at least a
couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up expecting the worst Then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen Eleven Effie Trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering
and congratulating me But it doesnt seem real There must be a mistake How    How could that happen I ask Haymitch Guess they liked your temper he says Theyve got a show to put on They need some players with some heat Katniss the girl who was
on fire says Cinna and gives me a hug Oh wait until you see your interview dress More flames I ask Of a sort he says mischievously Peeta and I congratulate each other another awkward moment Weve both done well but what does thatmean for the other I escape to
my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers The stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me out I drift off reprieved relieved and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids At dawn I lie in bed for a while watching the
sun come up on a beautiful morning Its Sunday A day off at home I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week Rising early hunting and gathering then trading at the Hob I think of Gale without
me Both of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair Particularly if were trying for bigger game But also in thelittler things having a partner lightened the load could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable I had been struggling along on my
own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods It was a Sunday in October the air cool and pungent with dying things Id spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss The
only meat Id shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources Having strayed farther afield than usual I was hurrying back home lugging my burlap sacks when
I came across a dead rabbit It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head About fifteen yards away was another I recognized the twitchup snares because my father had used them When the prey is caught its yanked into the air out of
the reach of other hungry animals Id been trying to use snares all summer with no success so I couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out Thats dangerous I jumped

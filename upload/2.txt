you
do I say irritated Forget it he snaps back The conversation feels all wrong Leave How could I leave Prim who is the only person in the world Im certain I love And Gale is devoted to his family We cant leave so why bother talking about it And even
if we did    Even if we did    Where did this stuff about having kids come from Theres never been anything romantic between Gale and me When we met I was a skinnytwelveyearold and although he was only two years older he already looked like
a man It took a long time for us to even become friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out Besides if he wants kids Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife Hes goodlooking hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines
and he can hunt You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think Good hunting partners are hard to find What do you want to do
I ask We can hunt fish or gather Lets fish at the lake We can leave our poles and gather in the woods Get something nice for tonight he says Tonight After the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate And a lot of people do out of relief that their
children have been spared for another year But at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doorsand try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come We make out well The predators ignore us on a day when easier tastier prey abounds By late
morning we have a dozen fish a bag of greens and best of all a gallon of strawberries I found the patch a few years ago but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals On the way home we swing by the
Hob the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains the Hob gradually took over the space Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping
day but the black markets still fairly busy We easily trade six of the fish for good bread the other two for salt Greasy Sae the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a
couple of chunks of paraffin We might do a tad better elsewhere but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae Shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog We dont hunt them on purpose but if youre attacked and
you take out a dog or two well meat is meat Once its in the soup Ill call it beef Greasy Sae says with a wink No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the Peacekeepers who come to the
Hob can afford to be a little choosier When we finish our business at the market we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries knowing he hasa particular fondness for them and can afford our price The mayors daughter Madge opens the door
Shes in my year at school Being the mayors daughter youd expect her to be a snob but shes all right She just keeps to herself Like me Since neither of us really has a group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at school Eating lunch
sitting next to each other at assemblies partnering for sports activities We rarely talk which suits us both just fine Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon Reaping clothes Pretty dress says Gale
Madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic It is a pretty dress but she would never be wearing it ordinarily She presses her lips together and then smiles Well if I end up going to the Capitol I
want to look nice dont I Now its Gales turn to be confused Does she mean it Or is she messing with him Im guessing the second You wont be going to the Capitol says Gale coolly His eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her dress Real
gold Beautifully crafted It could keep a family in bread for months What can you have Five entries I had six when I was just twelve years old Thats not her fault I say No its no ones fault Just the way it is says Gale Madges face has become
closed offShe puts the money for the berries in my hand Good luck Katniss You too I say and the door closes We walk toward the Seam in silence I dont like that Gale took a dig at Madge but hes right of course The reaping system is unfair with
the poor getting the worst of it You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve That year your name is entered once At thirteen twice And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen the final year of eligibility when your name goes
into the pool seven times Thats true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem But heres the catch Say you are poor and starving as we were You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae Each tessera is

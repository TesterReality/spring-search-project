and
he turns away But there are still thousands of slips I wish I could whisper to him Its time for the drawing Effie Trinket says as she always does Ladies first and crosses tothe glass ball with the girls names She reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball
and pulls out a slip of paper The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and Im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me that itsnot me that its not me Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes the
slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear voice And its not me Its Primrose Everdeen2One time when I was in a blind in a tree waiting motionless for game to wander by I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back
It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs and I lay there struggling to inhale to exhale to do anything Thats how I feel now trying to remember how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside
of my skull Someone is gripping my arm a boy from the Seam and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me There must have been some mistake This cant be happening Prim was one slip of paper in thousands Her chances of being chosen so remote
that Id not even bothered to worry about her Hadnt I done everything Taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same One slip One slip in thousands The odds had been entirely in her favor But it hadnt mattered Somewhere far away I can hear the crowd murmuring
unhappily as they always do when a twelveyearold gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair And then I see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing me and I see the
back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt Its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself Prim The strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again Prim I dont need to shove
through the crowd The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps With one sweep of my arm I push her behind me I volunteer I gasp I volunteer as tribute Theres some
confusion on the stageDistrict 12 hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty The rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read
can step forward to take his or her place In some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated But in District 12 where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers
are all but extinct Lovely says Effie Trinket But I believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um    She trails off unsure herself What does it matter says the mayor Hes
looking at me with a pained expression on his face He doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there I am the girl who brings the strawberries The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother
andsister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor A medal for her father vaporized in the mines Does he remember that What does it matter he repeats gruffly Let her come forward Prim is screaming hysterically behind me Shes wrapped her skinny arms around me
like a vice No Katniss No You cant go Prim let go I say harshly because this is upsetting me and I dont want to cry When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and Ill be marked as an easy target
A weakling I will give no one that satisfaction Let go I can feel someone pulling her from my back I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms Up you go Catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep
steady and then he carries Prim off toward my mother I steel myself and climb the steps Well bravo gushes Effie Trinket Thats the spirit of the Games Shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it Whats your name I swallow hard Katniss
Everdeen I say I bet my buttons that was your sister Dont want her to steal all the glory do we Come on everybody Lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills Effie Trinket To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12 not one
person claps Not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring Possibly because they know me from the Hob or knew my father or have encountered Prim who noone can help loving So instead of acknowledging applause I stand there unmoving while they take part
in the boldest form of dissent they can manage Silence Which says we do not agree We do not condone All of this is wrong Then something unexpected happens At least I dont expect it because I dont think of District 12 as a place that cares about me

cannon
fires and Im guessing the girl from District 4 has just died I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call which means a hovercraft is about to appear Confused I think its for Glimmer although this doesnt quite make sense because Im still in the
picture still fighting for the arrows I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles In the middle of the sky I spot the hovercraft I throw myself over Glimmers body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from
District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing Do this I command myself Clenching my jaw I dig my hands underGlimmers body get a hold on what must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach I cant help it Im hyperventilating now the whole thing is
so nightmarish and Im losing my grasp on whats real I tug on the silver sheath of arrows but its caught on something her shoulder blade something and finally yank it free Ive just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps several pairs coming through the
underbrush and I realize the Careers have come back Theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both But its too late to run I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see
three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I cant do it I cant do it I cant do it Im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees spear lifted poised to throw The shock on Peetas face makes no sense to me I wait for
the blow Instead his arm drops to his side What are you still doing here he hisses at me I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear His whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew Are you mad Hes
prodding me with the shaft of the spear now Get up Get up I rise but hes still pushing at me What What is going on He shoves me away from him hard Run he screams RunBehind him Cato slashes his way through the brush Hes sparkling wet too and
badly stung under one eye I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says Holding tightly to my bow and arrows banging into trees that appear out of nowhere tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance Back past my pool and into
unfamiliar woods The world begins to bend in alarming ways A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I cant shake
them free Theyre climbing up my arms my neck Someones screaming a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath I have a vague ideait might be me I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest Tucking
my knees up to my chin I wait for death Sick and disoriented Im able to form only one thought Peeta Mellark just saved my life Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out15 I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a
greater terror awaiting me All the things I dread most all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I cant help but believe theyre real Each time I wake I think At last this is over but it isnt Its only the beginning of a new
chapter of torture How many ways do I watch Prim die Relive my fathers last moments Feel my own body ripped apart This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain When I finally do come to
my senses I lie still waiting for the next onslaught of imagery But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system leaving my body wracked and feeble Im still lying on my side locked in the fetal position I lift a hand
to my eyes to find them sound untouched by ants that never existed Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort So many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them Very very slowly I manage to sit up Im in a shallow hole not
filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old dead leaves My clothings damp but I dont know whether pond water dew rain or sweat is the cause For a long time all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottleand watch a beetle crawl
up the side of a honeysuckle bush How long have I been out It was morning when I lost reason Now its afternoon But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed even two possibly If so Ill have no way of knowing which tributes survived
that tracker jacker attack Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4 But there was the boy from District 1 both tributes from District 2 and Peeta Did they die from the stings Certainly if they lived their last days must have been as horrid as my own And what
about Rue Shes so small it wouldnt take much venom to do her in But then again    The tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her and she had a good head start A foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water has little effect on

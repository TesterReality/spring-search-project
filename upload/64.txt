All
I have left are Rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and one strip of beef Now you have to hunt Katniss I tell myself I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack After I climb down the tree I conceal the boys knives and spearheads in
a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them Ive lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream I know Im on course when I come across Rues third
unlit fire Shortly thereafter I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them I return to Rues signal fire and start it up not caring about the excessive smoke Where are you Cato I think as I roast the
birds and Rues roots Imwaiting right here Who knows where the Careers are now Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or  Is it possible Too scared of me They know I have the bow and arrows of course Cato saw me take
them from Glimmers body but have they put two and two together yet Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career Possibly they think Thresh did this Wouldnt he be more likely to revenge Rues death than I would Being from the same district Not that
he ever took any interest in her And what about Foxface Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies No When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise I doubt they think Peeta
has lit this signal fire Catos sure hes as good as dead I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof Perhaps if he wins the Games hell see me on
victors night when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform surrounded by their support crew But I told Rue Id be there For both of us And somehow
that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim I really think I stand a chance of doing it nowWinning Its not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times although those things help Something happened when I was holding Rues hand watching the life
drain out of her Now I am determined to revenge her to make her loss unforgettable and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot but no one does Maybe the other tributes are out
there beating one another senseless Which would be fine Ever since the bloodbath Ive been featured on screens most than I care Eventually I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over
me and even though its only early evening I climb a tree and settle in for the night My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday I keep seeing Rue speared my arrow piercing the boys neck I dont know why I should even care about the boy Then
I realize    He was my first kill Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets every tribute has a list of kills I guess technically Id get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4 too for dumping that nest on them
But the boy from District 1 was the first person I knew would die because of my actionsNumerous animals have lost their lives at my hands but only one human I hear Gale saying How different can it be really Amazingly similar in the execution A bow pulled an arrow
shot Entirely different in the aftermath I killed a boy whose name I dont even know Somewhere his family is weeping for him His friendscall for my blood Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back    But then I think of Rues still
body and Im able to banish the boy from my mind At least for now Its been an uneventful day according to the sky No deaths I wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together If its going to be tonight I want to get
some sleep first I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation For the most part the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll But occasionally there
will be trumpets followed by an announcement Usually this will be a call to a feast When food is scarce the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia as an inducement to gather and fight Sometimes there is a feastand sometimes theres
nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for I wouldnt go in for the food but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors Claudius Templesmiths voice booms down from overhead congratulating the six of us who remain But he is
not inviting us to a feast Hes saying something very confusing Theres been a rule change in the Games A rule change That in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the

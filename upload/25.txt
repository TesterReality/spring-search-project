contempt
in the glances of the Career Tributes Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me They project arrogance and brutality When Atala releases us they head straight for the deadliestlooking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease Im thinking that its lucky Im a fast runner
when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump He is still beside me per Haymitchs instructionsHis expression is sober Where would you like to start I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off clearly trying to intimidate the field Then at the others the underfed the incompetent
shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax Suppose we tie some knots I say Right you are says Peeta We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students You get the feeling that the knottying class is not the Hunger games
hot spot When he realizes I know something about snares he shows us a simple excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it Then we move on
to camouflage Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin weaving disguises from vines and leaves The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work I do the cakes he admits
to me The cakes I ask Ive been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards What cakes At home The iced ones for the bakery he says He means the ones they display in the windows Fancy cakes with
flowers and pretty things painted in frosting Theyre for birthdaysand New Years Day When were in the square Prim always drags me over to admire them although wed never be able to afford one Theres little enough beauty in District 12 though so I can hardly deny her this I
look more critically at the design on Peetas arm The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods I wonder how he knows this since I doubt hes ever been beyond the fence Has he been able to pick this up from just
that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard Somehow the whole thing his skill those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me Its lovely If only you could frost someone to death I say Dont be so superior You can never tell what youll find in the
arena Say its actually a gigantic cake begins Peeta Say we move on I break in So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station We do pick up some valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing to making shelter Despite Haymitchs
order to appear mediocre Peeta excels in handtohand combat and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though wanting to save those for our private sessions The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day Twenty or so men and women
dressed in deep purple robes They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch us jotting down notes other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring the lot of us But they do seem to be keeping their
eye on the District 12 tributes Several times Ive looked up to find one fixated on me They consult with the trainers during our meals as well We see them all gathered together when we come back Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at lunch the twentyfour
of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove their superiority that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest
of us beneath notice Most of the other tributes sit alone like lost sheep No one says a word to us Peeta and I eat together and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals Its not easy to find a
topic Talking of home is painful Talking of the present unbearable One day Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful toinclude types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol The fishshaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4 The crescent
moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11 Somehow although its made from the same stuff it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home And there you have it says Peeta scooping the breads back in the basket You certainly
know a lot I say Only about bread he says Okay now laugh as if Ive said something funny We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room All right Ill keep smiling pleasantly and you talk says Peeta Its wearing us both out
Haymitchs direction to be friendly Because ever since I slammed my door theres been a chill in the air between us But we have our orders Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear Iask No but it sounds fascinating says Peeta I try
and animate my face as I recall the event a true story in which Id foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue Hes much better at this than I am On the second day while were taking

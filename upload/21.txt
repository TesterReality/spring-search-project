dont
see how Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend Besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me She has reminded me why Im here Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies But to die a bloody death
while the crowds urge on my killer To tell or not to tell My brain still feels slow from the wine I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there Peeta picks up on my hesitation Have you been on the roof yet I shake my head
Cinna showed me You can practically see the whole city The winds a bit loud though I translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my head You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here Can we just go up Sure come on says
Peeta I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof Theres a small domeshaped room with a door to the outside As we step into the cool windy evening air I catch my breath at the view The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies
Electricity in District 12 comes and goes usually we only have it a few hours a day Often the evenings are spent in candlelight The only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the Games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch
But here there would be no shortage Ever Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof I look straight down the side of the building to the street which is buzzing with people You can hear their cars an occasional shout and a strange metallic
tinkling In District 12 wed all be thinking about bed right now I asked Cinna why they let us up here Werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side says Peeta Whatd he say I ask You cant says Peeta He holds
out his hand into seemingly empty space Theres a sharp zap and he jerks it back Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof Always worried about our safety I say Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof I wonder if were supposed to be up
here now so late and alone Ive never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before But that doesnt mean were not being taped Do you think theyre watching us now Maybe he admits Come see the garden On the other side of the dometheyve built a garden with flower
beds and potted trees From the brancheshang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the tinkling I heard Here in the garden on this windy night its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard Peeta looks at me expectantly I pretend to examine a
blossom We were hunting in the woods one day Hidden waiting for game I whisper You and your father he whispers back No my friend Gale Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once Except one As if it were giving a warning call And then we saw her Im
sure it was the same girl A boy was with her Their clothes were tattered They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep They were running as if their lives depended on it I say For a moment Im silent as I remember how the sight of this
strange pair clearly not from District 12 fleeing through the woods immobilized us Later we wondered if we could have helped them escape Perhaps we might have Concealed them If wed moved quickly Gale and I were taken by surprise yes but were both hunters We know how animals look
at bay We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them But we only watched The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere I continue to Peeta I mean one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there It didnt make a sound but they
saw it A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up fast so fast like the elevator They shot some sort of spear through the boy It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well But Im certain he was dead We heard the
girl scream once The boys name I think Then it was gone the hovercraft Vanished into thin air And the birds began to sing again as if nothing had happened Did they see you Peeta asked I dont know We were under a shelf of rock I reply But I
do know There was a moment after the birdcall but before the hovercraft where the girl had seen us Shed locked eyes with me and called out for help But neither Gale or I had responded Youre shivering says Peeta The wind and the story have blown all the warmth
from my body The girls scream Had it been her last Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders I start to take a step back but then I let him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness A friend would do
that right They were from here he asks and he secures a button at my neck I nod Theyd had that Capitol look about them The boy and the girl Where do you suppose they were going he asks I dont know that I say District 12 is pretty much
the end of the line Beyond us theres only wilderness If you dont count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxicbombs They show it on television occasionally just to remind us Or why they would leave here Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors Against what

withlife and death hell probably turn into one of those rage beast tribute the kind who try to eat someone heart aft theyve kill them there was a guy like that a few year ago from district 6 called titus he went complete savage and the gamemakers had to havehim stunned with electric gun to collect the body of the play he kill before he ate them there are no rule in the arena but cannibalism doesnt play well with the capitol audience so they tried to head it off there was some speculate that the avalanche that finallytook titus out was specifically engineer to ensure the victor was not a lunatic i dont see peeta in the morning cinna come to me before dawn give me a simple shift to wear and guide me to the roof my final dress and preparation will be alone in thecatacombs under the arena itself a hovercraft appear out of thin air just like the one did in the woods the day i saw the redhead avox girl capture and a ladder drop down i place my hand and feet on the lowerrungs and instant it as if im frozensome sort of current glue me to the ladder while im lift safely inside i expect the ladder to release me then but im still stuck when a woman in a white coat approach me carry a syringe this is just your track katniss the still you are the moreefficiently i can place it she say still im a statue but that doesnt prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle insert the metal track device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm now the gamemakers will always be able totrace my whereabouts in the arena wouldnt want to lose a tribute as soon as the track in place the ladder release me the woman disappear and cinna is retrieve from the roof an avox boy come in and direct us to a room where breakfast ha been laid outdespite the tension in my stomach i eat as much as i can although none of the delectable food make any impression on me im so nervous i could be eat coal dust the one thing that distract me at all is the view from the window as we sailover the city and then to the wilder beyond this is what bird see only they free and safe the very opposite of me the ride last about half an hour before the window black out suggest that were near the arena the hovercraft land and cinna and i gobackto the ladder only this time it lead down into a tube underground into the catacomb that lie beneath the arena we follow instruction to my destination a chamber for my preparation in the capitol they call it the launch room in the district it referred to as the stockyardthe place animal go before slaughter everything is brandnew i will be the first and only tribute to use this launch room the arena are historic site preserved aft the game popular destinate for capitol resident to visit to vacation go for a month rewatch the game tour the catacombsvisit the site where the deaths took place you can even take part in reenactment they say the food is excellent i struggle to keep my breakfast down as i shower and clean my teeth cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back then the clothesarrive the same for every tribute cinna ha had no say in my outfit does not even know what will be in the package but he help me dress in the undergarments simple tawny pant light green blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black jacket that fall to mythighs the material in the jacket designed to reflect body heat expect some cool night he say the boot worn over skintight sock are better than i could have hoped for soft leather not unlike my one athome these have a narrow flexible rubber sole with tread though good forrunning i think im finished when cinna pull the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket i had complete forgotten about it where did you get that i ask off the green outfit you wore on the train he say i remember nowtaking it off my moth dress pinning it tothe shirt it your district token right i nod and he fast it on my shirt it bare cleared the review board some thought the pin could be used as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage but eventual they let it through say cinna they eliminate a ring fromthat district one girl though if you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out poison one she claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did but she lost he token there you all set move around make sure everything feel comfortablei walk run in a circle swing my arms about yes it fine fit perfect then there nothing to do but wait for the call say cinna unless you think you could eat any more i turn down food but accept a glass of water that i take tiny sipsof as we wait on a couch i dont want to chew on my nail or lip so ifind myself gnaw on the inside of my cheek it still hasnt fully heal from a few day ago soon the taste of blood fill my mouth nervous seep into terror asi anticipate what is to come i could be dead flatout dead in an hour not even my finger obsessive trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman inject the track device i press on it even though it hurt i press on it so hard

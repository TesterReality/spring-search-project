thepond lily to make a nice meal i snuggle down in my sleep bag hang on to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is a few hour laterthe stampede of feet shake me from slumber i look around in bewilderment it not yet dawn but mystinging eye can see it it would be hard to miss the wall of fire descend on me13my first impulse is to scramble from the tree but im belted in somehow my fumbling finger release the buckle and i fall to the ground in a heap still snarl in mysleeping bag there no time for any kind of pack fortunate my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag i shove in the belt hoist the bag over my shoulder and flee the world ha transformed to flame and smoke burning branch crack from tree and fall inshowers of spark at my feet all i can do is follow the other the rabbit and deer and i even spot a wild dog pack shoot through the woods i trust their sense of direction because their instinct are sharpe than mine but they are much fast fly throughthe underbrush so graceful as my boot catch on root and fall tree limb that there no way i can keep apace with them the heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the smoke which threat to suffocate me at any moment i pull the top of myshirt up over my nose grateful to find it soak in sweat and it off a thin veil of protection and i run choking my bag bang against my back my face cut with branch that materialize from the gray haze without warning because i know i am supposed tor this was no tribute campfire gone out of control no accidental occurrence the flame that bear down on me have an unnatural height a uniformity that mark them as humanmade machinemade gamemakermade the have been too quiet today no deaths perhaps no fight at all the audience in thecapitol will be getting bore claim that these game are verge on dull this is the one thing the game must not do it not hard to follow the gamemakers motivate there is the career pack and then there are the rest of us probably spread far and thin acrossthe arena this fire is designed to flush us out to drive us together it may not be the most original device ive seen but it very very effective i hurdle over a burning log not high enough the tail end of my jacket catch on fire and i haveto stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flame but i dont dare leave the jacket scorch andsmoldering as it is i take the risk of shove it in my sleep bag hope the lack of air will quell what i havent extinguish this is alli have what i carry on my back and it little enough to survive with in a matter of minute my throat and nose are burning the cough begin soon aft and my lung begin to feel as if they are actual bee cooked discomfort turn to distress until eachbreath sends a searing pain through my chest i manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomit begin and i lose my meager supper and whatever water ha remain in my stomach crouch on my hand and knee i retch until there nothing left to comeup i know i need to keep moving but im tremble and lightheaded now gasping for air i allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallow from my bottle you get one minute i tell myself one minute to resti take the time to reorder my supply wad up the sleep bag and messy stuff everything into the backpack my minute up i know it time to move on but the smoke ha clouded my thought the swiftfooted animal that were my compass have left me behind i knowi havent been in this part of the woods before there were no sizable rock like the one im shelter against on my early travelswhere are the gamemakers drive me back to the lake to a whole new terrain filled with new dang i had just found a few hoursof peace at the pond when this attack began would there be any way i could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least the wall of fire must have anend and it wont burn indefinite not because the gamemakerscouldnt keep it fuel but because again that would invite accusation of boredom from the audience if i could get back behind the fire line i could avoid meet up with the career ive just decided to try and loop back around although it will require mile of travel awayfrom the inferno and then a very circuitous route back when the first fireball blast into the rock about two feet from my head i spring out from under my ledge energized by renew fear the game ha taken a twist the fire was just to get us moving nowthe audience will get to see some real fun when i hear the next hiss i flatten on the ground not take time to look the fireball hit a tree off to my left engulfing it in flame to remain still is death im bare on my feet before thethird ball hit the ground where i was lying send a pillar of fire up behind me timeloses meaning now as i frantically try to dodge the attack i cant see where they bee launch from but it not a hovercraft the angle are not extreme enough probably this

buthe must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live still seeing him only add to my sense of unease over why the career would possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed him to live at all all four tribute seem tostill be recover from the track jack attack even from here i can see the large swollen lump on their body they must not have had the sense to remove the sting or if they did not known about the leave that heal them apparently whatever medicine they found inthe cornucopia have been ineffective the cornucopia sit in it original position but it inside have been pick clean most of the supply held in crate burlap sack and plastic bin are pile neat in a pyramid in what seem a questionable distance from the camp other are sprinkle aroundthe perimeter of the pyramid almost mimicking the layout of supply around the cornucopia at the onset of the game a canopy of netting that aside from discouraging bird seem to be useless shelter the pyramid itself the whole setup is complete perplex the distance the netting and the presenceof the boy from district 3 one the for sure destroy those supply is not go to be as simple as it look some other factor is at play here and id better stay put until i figure out what it is my guess is the pyramid is boobytrapped insome manner i think of conceal pit descend net a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart real thepossibilities are endless while i am mull over my option i hear cato shout out he pointe up to the woods far beyond me and without turn iknowthat rue must have set the first campfire wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable the career begin to arm themselves at once an argument break out it loud enough for me to hear that it concern whether or not the boy from district3 should stay or accompany them he come we need him in the woods and his job done here anyway no one can touch those supply say cato what about lover boy say the boy from district 1 i keep telling you forget about him i know where i cuthim it a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet at any rate he in no shape to raid us say cato so peeta is out there in the woods wound bad but i am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the career come on sayscato he thrust a spear into the hand of the boy from district 3 and they head off in the direction of the fire the last thing i hear as they enter the woods is cato say when we find he i kill he in my own way and noone interfere somehow i dont think he talk about rue she didnt drop a nest of acker jack on him i stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supply the one advantage i have with the bow and arrowis distance i could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easy enough im a good enough shot to get it through those open in the net but there no guarantee it would catch more likely itd just burn itself out and then what id have achieved nothing and giventhem far too much information about myself that i was here that i have an accomplice that i can use the bow and arrow with accuracy there no alternative im go to have to get in close and see if i cant discover what exact protect the supply in factim just about to reveal myself when a movement catch my eye several hundred yard to my right i see someone emerge from the woods for a second i think it rue but then i recognize foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creep out onto the plainwhen she decide it safe she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps just before she reach the circle of supply that have been litter around the pyramid she stop search the ground and careful place he feet on a spot then she begin to approach the pyramid withstrange little hop sometime land on one foot teetering slightlysometimes risk a few steps at one point she launch up in the air over a small barrel and land poise on he tiptoe but she overshot slight and he momentum throw he forward i hear he give a sharp squealas he hand hit the ground but nothing happen in a moment shes regain he feet and continue until she ha reach the bulk of the supply so im right about the booby trap but it clear more complex than i had imagine i was right about the girl toohow wily is she to have discovered this pa into the food and to be able to replicate it so neat she fill herpack take a few item from a variety of contain crack from a crate a handful of apple from a burlap sack that hang suspended from arope off the side of a bin but only a handful from each not enough to tip off that the food is miss not enough to cause suspicion and then shes doing he odd little dance back out of the circle and scamper into the woods again safe and soundi realize im grinding my teeth in frustrate foxface ha confirmed what id already guessed but what sort of trap have they laid that require such dexterity ha so many trigger point why did she squeal so as he hand made contact with the earth youd have thought

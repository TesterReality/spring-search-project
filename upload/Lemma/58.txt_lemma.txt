and slow it begin to dawn on me youd have thought the very ground was go to explode it mine i whisper that explain everything the career willing to leave their supply foxfaces reaction the involvement of the boy from district 3 where they have thefactories where they make televise and automobile and explosive but where did he get them in the supply that not the sort of weapon the gamemakers usual provide given that they like to see the tribute draw blood personal i slip out of the bush and cross to one ofthe round metal plate that lift the tribute into the arena the ground around it ha been dug up and patted back down the land mine were disable aft the sixty second we stood on the plate but the boy from district 3 must have managed to reactivate them ivenever seen anyone in the game do that i bet it came as a shock even to the gamemakers well hurray for the boy from district 3 for putting one over on them but what am i supposed to do now obvious i cant go stroll into that mess withoutblowing myself skyhigh as for send in a burning arrow that more laughable than ever the mine are set off by pressure it doesnt have to be a lot either one year a girldropped he token a small wooden ball while she was at he plate and they literal hadto scrape bits of he off the ground my arms pretty good i might be able to chuck some rock in there and set off what maybe one mine that could start a chain reaction or could it would the boy from district 3 have placed the mine in sucha way that a single mine would not disturb the other thereby protect the supply but ensure the death of the invade even if i only blew up one mine id draw the career back down on me for sure and anyway what am i thinking there that net clearlystrung to deflect any such attack beside what id real need is to throw about thirty rock in there at once setting off a big chain reaction demolish the whole lot i glance back up at the woods the smoke from rue second fire is waft toward the sky bynow the career have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick time is running out there is a solution to this i know there is if i can only focus hard enough i stare at the pyramid thebins the crate too heavy to topple over with an arrow maybeone contain cooke oil and the burning arrow idea is revive when i realize i could end uplosing all twelve of my arrow and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since id just be guess im genuine thinking of trying to recreate foxfaces trip up to thepyramid in hope of find a new mean of destruction when my eye light on the burlap bag of apple i could sever the rope in one shot didnt i do as much in the train cent it a big bag but it still might only be good for oneexplosion if only i could free the apple themselves i know what to do i move into range and give myself three arrow to get the job done i place my feet careful block out the rest of the world as i take meticulous aim the firstarrow tear through the side of the bag near the top leave a split in the burlap the second widen it to a gaping hole i can see the first apple teetering when i let the third arrow go catch the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from thebag for a moment everything seem frozen in time then the apple spill to the ground and im blown backward into the air17the impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain knock the wind out of memy backpack does little to soften the blow fortunate my quiver ha caught inthe crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my shoulder and my bow is locke in my grasp the ground still shake with explosion i cant hear them i cant hear anything at the moment but the apple must have set off enough mine cause debris to activate theothers i manage to shield my face with my arms as shatter bits of matter some of it burning rain down around me an acrid smoke fill the air which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe aft about a minute the groundstops vibrate i roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recent the pyramid the career arent likely to salvage anything out of that id better get out of here i think theyll be make a beeline for theplace but once im on my feet i realize escape may not be so simple im dizzy not the slight wobbly kind but the kind that sends the tree swoop around you and cause the earth to move in wave under your feet i take a few steps and somehowwind up on my hand and knee i wait a few minute to let it pass but it doesnt panic begin to set in i cant stay here flight is essential but i can neither walk nor hear i place a hand to my left ear theone that was turnedtoward the blast and it come away bloody have i gone deaf from the explosion the idea fright me i rely as much on my ear as my eye as a hunt maybe more at time but i cant let my fear show absolute positive i am live on

cheekthen shes gone and im left thinking that maybe madge real ha been my friend all along final gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he op his arms i dont hesitate to go into them his body is familiar to me the wayit move the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beat i know from quiet moment on a hunt but this is the first time i real feel it lean and hardmuscled against my own listen he say getting a knife should be pretty easy but youvegot to get your hand on a bow that your best chance they dont always have bows i say thinking of theyear there were only horrible spike mace that the tribute had to bludgeon one another to death with then make one say gale even a weak bow is betterthan no bow at all i have tried copy my father bows with poor result it not that easy even he had to scrap his own work sometime i dont even know if therell be wood i say another year they toss everybody into a landscape of nothing but bouldersand sand and scruffy bush i particular hate that year many contestant were bitten by venomous snake or went insane from thirst there almost always some wood gale say since that year half of them die of cold not much entertainment in that it true we spent one hunger gameswatching theplayers freeze to death at night you could hard see them because they were just huddle in ball and had no wood for fire or torch or anything it was considered very anticlimactic in the capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths since then there usual been wood to makefires yes there usual some i say katniss it just hunt you the best hunt i know say gale it not just hunt they armed they think i say so do you and youve had more practice realpractice he say you know how to kill not people i say howdifferent can it be real say gale grim the awful thing is that if i can forget they people it will be no different at all the peacekeeper are back too soon and gale ask for more time but they take him away and i start to panic dont letthem starve i cry out cling to his hand i wont you know i wont katniss remember i he say and they yank us apart and slam the door and ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember it a short ride from the justice building tothe train station ive never been in a car before rare even ridden in wagon in the seam we travel on foot ive been right not to cry the station is swarm with report with their insectlike camera trained direct on my face but ive had a lot of practiceat wipe my face clean of emote and i do this now i catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that aire my arrival live and feel gratified that i appear almost bore peeta mellark on the other hand ha obvious been cry and interestinglyenough does not seem to be trying to cover it up i immediate wonder if this will be his strategy in the game to appear weak and frighten to reassure the other tribute that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting this work verywell for agirl johanna mason from district 7 a few year back she seem like such a snivel cowardly fool that no one bothered about he until there were only a handful of contestant left it turn out she could kill vicious pretty clever the way she play it but this seemsan odd strategy for peeta mellark because he a bake son all those year of have enough to eat and haul bread tray around have made him broadshouldered and strong it will take an awful lot of weep to convince anyone to overlook him we have to stand for afew minute in the doorway of the train while the camera gobble up our image then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us the train begin to move at once the speed initial takes my breath away of course ive never been on a train as travelbetween the district is forbidden except for officially sanction duty for us that main transport coal but this is no ordinary coal train it one of the highspeed capitol models that average 250 mile per hour our journey to the capitol will take less than a day in school theytell us the capitolwas built in a place once called the rocky district 12 was in a region known isappalachia even hundred of year ago they mine coal here which is why our mine have to dig so deep somehow it all come back to coal at school beside basicreading and math most of our instruction is coalrelated except for the weekly lecture on the history of panem it most a lot of blather about what we owe the capitol i know there must be more than they telling us an actual account of what happen during the rebellionbut i dont spend much time thinking about it whatever the truth is i dont see how it will help me get food on the table the tribute train is fancier than even the room in the justice building we are each given our own chamber that have a bedrooma dress area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water we dont have hot water at home unless we boil it there are draw filled with fine cloth and effie trinket tell me to do anything i want wear anything i want everything is at my

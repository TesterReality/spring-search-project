id have to get wild one from the woods idont recognize the grain our own tessera ration cook down to an unattractive brown mush fancy roll would mean another trade with the baker perhaps for two or three squirrel as for thepudding i cant even guess whats in it day of hunt and gather for this one meal andeven then it would be a poor substitute for the capitol verse what must it be like i wonder to live in a world where food appear at the press of a button how would i spend the hour i now commit to combe the woods for sustenance if itwere so easy to come by what do they do all day these people in the capitol beside decorate their body and waite around for a new shipment of tribute to roll in and die for their entertainment i look up and find cinna eye trained on mine how despicablewe must seem to you he say ha he seen this in my face or somehow read my thought he right though the whole rotten lot of them is despicable no matter say cinna so katniss about your costume for the opening ceremony my partner portia is the stylist foryour fellow tribute peeta and our current thought is to dress you in complementary costume say cinna as you know it customary to reflect the flavor of the district for the opening ceremony you supposed to wear something that suggest your district principal industry district 11 agriculture district 4 fishingdistrict 3 factory this mean that come from district 12 peeta and i will be in some kind of coal mine getupsince the baggy mine jumpsuits are not particular becoming our tribute usual end up in skimpy outfit and hat with headlamp one year our tribute were stark naked andcovered in black powder to represent coal dust it always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd i prepare myself for the worst so ill be in a coal mine outfit i ask hope it wont be indecent not exact you see portia and i think thatcoal mine the very overdone no one will remember you in that and we both see it as our job to make the district twelve tribute unforgettable say cinna ill be naked for sure i think so rather than focus on the coal mine itself were go to focus onthe coal say cinna naked and cover in black dust i think and what do we do with coal we burn it say cinna you not afraid of fire are you katniss he see my expression and grin a few hour late i am dress in what will either bethe most sensational or the deadly costume in the opening ceremony im in a simple black unitard that cove me from ankle to neck shiny leather boot lace up to my knee but it the flutter cape made of stream of orange yellowand red and the match headpiece that definethis costume cinna plan to light them on fire just before our chariot roll into the street it not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire portia and i came up with youll be perfect safe he say but im not convinced i wont be perfect barbecue bythe time we reach the citys cent my face is relative clear of makeup just a bit of highlight here and there my hair ha been brush out and then braid down my back in my usual style i want the audience to recognize you when you in the arenasays cinna dreamy katniss the girl who was on fire it cross my mind that cinna calm and normal demeanor mask a complete madman despite this morn revelation about peetas character im actual relieved when he show up dress in an identical costume he should know about fire bee abakers son and all his stylist portia and he team accompany him in and everyone is absolute giddy with excitement over what a splash well make except cinna he just seem a bit weary as he accept congratulate were whisk down to the bottom level of the remake cent whichis essential a gigantic stable the opening ceremony are about to start pair of tribute are bee load into chariot pull by team of four horsesours are coal black the animal are so well trained no one even need to guide their rein cinna and portia direct us into thechariot and careful arrange our body position the drape of our cape before moving off to consult with each other what do you think i whisper to peeta about the fire ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine he say through gritted teeth deal i say maybeif we can get them off soon enough well avoid the worst burn it bad though theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in i know we promise haymitch wed do exact what they said but i dont think he considered this angle where is haymitchanyway isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing say peeta with all that alcohol in him it probably not advisable to have him around an open flame i say and sudden were both laughing i guess were both so nervous about the game and more pressinglypetrified of bee turn into human torch were not act sensibly the opening music begin it easy to hear blast around the capitol massive doors slide open revealing the crowdlined street the ride last about twenty minute and end up at the city circle where they will welcome us

smile that seem so genuine sweet with just theright touch of shyness that unexpected warm rush through me a warning bell goes off in my head dont be so stupid peeta is planning how to kill you i remind myself he is lure you in to make you easy prey the more likable he is the more deadlyhe is but because two can play at this game i stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek right on his bruise6the train cent ha a tower designed exclusive for the tribute and their team this will be our home until the actual game begin each district ha an entirefloor you simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district easy enough to remember ive ridden the elevator a couple of time in the justice building back in district 12 once to receive the medal for my father death and then yesterday to say my finalgoodbyes to my friend andfamily but that a dark and creaky thing that move like a snail and smell of sour milk the wall of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ant as you shoot up intothe air it exhilarating and im tempt to ask effie trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seem childish apparently effie trinket duty did not conclude at the station she and haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena in a way that a plus becauseat least she can be counted on to corral us around to place on time whereas we havent seen haymitch since he agree to help us on the train probably passe out somewhere effie trinket on the other hand seem to be fly high were the first team shes everchaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremony shes complimentary about not just our costume but how we conduct ourselves and to hear he tell it effie know everyone who anyone in the capitol and ha been talk us up all day trying to win us sponsor ive beenvery mysterious though she say he eye squint half shut because of course haymitch hasnt bothered totell me your strategy but ive done my best with what i had

slaughter and whats she base our success on our table mann everyone ha their reservation natural you bee from the coal district but i said and this was very clever of me i said well if youput enough pressure on coal it turn to pearl effie beam at us so brilliant that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to he clever even though it wrong coal doesnt turn to pearl they grow in shellfish possibly she meant coal turn to diamond but that untruetoo ive heard they have some sort of machine in district 1 that can turn graphite into diamond but we dont mine graphite in district 12 that was part of district 13s job until they were destroy i wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day eitherknow or care unfortunate i cant seal the sponsor deal for you only haymitch can do that say effie grim but dont worry ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary although lack in many department effie trinket ha a certain determination i have to admire my quartersare large than our entire house back home they are plush like the train car but also have so many automatic gadget that im sure i wont have time to press all the buttons the shower alone ha a panel with more than a hundred option you can choose regulatingwater temperature pressure soap shampoo scent oil and massage sponge when you step out on a mat heat come on that blowdry your body instead of struggle with the knot in my wet hair i mere place my hand on a box that sendsa current through my scalp untangle partingand dry my hair almost instant it float down around my should in a glossy curtain i program the closet for an outfit to my taste the window zoom in and out on part of the city at my command you need only whisper a type of food from agigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appear hot

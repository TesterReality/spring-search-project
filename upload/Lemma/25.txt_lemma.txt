contempt the glance of the career tribute each must have fifty to a hundred pound on me they project arrogance and brutality when atala release us they head straight for the deadliestlooking weapon in the gym and handle them with ease im thinking that it lucky im a fast runnerwhen peeta nudge my arm and i jump he is still beside me per haymitchs instructionshis expression is sober where would you like to start i look around at the career tribute who are show off clear trying to intimidate the field then at the other the underfed the incompetentshakily have their first lesson with a knife or an ax suppose we tie some knot i say right you are say peeta we cross to an empty station where the train seem pleased to have student you get the feeling that the knotty class is not the hunger gameshot spot when he realizes i know something about snare he show us a simple excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree we concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have master it then we move onto camouflage peeta genuine seem to enjoy this station swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juice around on his pale skin weave disguise from vine and leave the train who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work i do the cake he admitsto me the cake i ask ive been preoccupy with watch the boy from district 2 send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yard what cake at home the ice one for the bakery he say he mean the one they display in the window fancy cake withflowers and pretty the painted in frost they for birthdaysand new year day when were in the square prim always drag me over to admire them although wed never be able to afford one there little enough beauty in district 12 though so i can hard deny he this ilook more critically at the design on peetas arm the alternate pattern of light and dark suggest sunlight fall through the leave in the woods i wonder how he know this since i doubt he ever been beyond the fence ha he been able to pick this up from justthat scraggly old apple tree in his backyard somehow the whole thing his skill those inaccessible cake the praise of the camouflage expert annoy me it lovely if only you could frost someone to death i say dont be so superior you can never tell what youll find in thearena say it actual a gigantic cake begin peeta say we move on i break in so the next three day pass with peeta and i go quiet from station to station we do pick up some valuable skill from start fire to knife throw to make shelter despite haymitchsorder to appear mediocre peeta excel in handtohand combat and i sweep the edible plant test without blinking an eye we steer clear of archery and weightlifting though want to save those for our private session the gamemakers appear early on the first day twenty or so men and womendressed in deep purple robe they sit in the elevate stand that surround the gymnasium sometime wander about to watch us jotting down note other time eat at the endless banquet that ha been set for them ignore the lot of us but they do seem to be keep theireye on the district 12 tribute several time ive look up to find one fixate on me they consult with the train during our meal as well we see them all gather together when we come back breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at lunch the twentyfourof us eat in a dine room off the gymnasium food is arrange on cart around the room and you serve yourself the career tribute tend to gather rowdy around one table as if to prove their superiority that they have no fear of one another and consider the restof us beneath notice most of the other tribute sit alone like lost sheep no one say a word to us peeta and i eat together and since haymitch keep dogging us about it try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meal it not easy to find atopic talk of home is painful talk of the present unbearable one day peeta empty our breadbasket and point out how they have been careful toinclude type from the district along with the refined bread of the capitol the fishshaped loaf tint green with seaweed from district 4 the crescentmoon roll dotted with seed from district 11 somehow although it made from the same stuff it look a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuit that are the standard fare at home and there you have it say peeta scoop the bread back in the basket you certainlyknow a lot i say only about bread he say okay now laugh as if ive said something funny we both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stare from around the room all right ill keep smiling pleasant and you talk say peeta it wearing us both outhaymitchs direction to be friendly because ever since i slammed my door there been a chill in the air between us but we have our order did i ever tell you about the time i was chase by a bear iask no but it sound fascinating say peeta i tryand animate my face as i recall the event a true story in which id foolish challenged a black bear over the right to a beehive peeta laughs and ask question right on cue he much better at this than i am on the second day while were take

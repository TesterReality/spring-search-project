github been loose for year there are several other weak spot in the fence but this one is so close to home i almost always enter the woods here as soon as im in the tree i retrieve a bow and sheath of arrow from a hollow log electrify or not the fence ha been successful at keep the flesheaters out of district 12 inside the woods they roam free and there are add concern like venomous snake rabid animal and no real paths to follow but there also food if you know how to find it my father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion there was nothing even to bury i was eleven then five year late i still wake up screaming for him to run even though trespass in the woods is illegal and poach carry the severe of penalty more people would risk it if they had weapon but most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife my bow is a rarity craft by my father along with a few other that i keep well hidden in the woods careful wrapped in waterproof cove my father could have made good money selle them but if the official found out he would have been public executed for incite a rebellion most of the peacekeeper turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because they as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is in fact they among our best custom but the idea that someone might be arm the seam would never have been allowed in the fall a few brave soul sneak into the woods to harvest apple but always in sight of the meadow always close enough to run back to the safety of district 12 if trouble arise district twelve where you can starve to death in safety i mutter then i glance quick over my shoulder even here even in the middle of nowhere you worry someone might overhear you when i was young i scare my mother to death the the i would blurt out about district 12 about the people who rule our country panem from the faroff city called the capitol eventual i understood this would only lead us to more trouble so i learned to hold my tongue and to turn my feature into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thought do my work quiet in school make only polite small talk in the public market discuss little more than trade in the hob which is the black market where i make most of my money even at home where i am less pleasant i avoid discuss tricky topic like the reap or food shortage or the hunger game prim might begin to repeat my word and then where would we be in the woods wait the only person with whom i can be myself gale i can feel thegithubdistrict 12 hasnt had a volunteer in decade and the protocol ha become rusty the rule is that once a tribute name ha been pull from the ball another eligible boy if a boy name ha been read or girl if a girl name ha been read can step forward to take his or he place in some district in which winning the reap is such a great honor people are eager to risk their live the volunteer is complicated but in district 12 where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteer are all but extinct lovely say effie trinket but i believe there a small matter of introduce the reap winner and then ask for volunteer and if one does come for then we um she trail off unsure herself what does it matter say the mayor he look at me with a paine expression on his face he doesnt know me real but there a faint recognition there i am the girl who bring the strawberry the girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion the girl who five year ago stood huddle with he mother andsister as he present he the old child with a medal of valor a medal for he father vaporized in the mine does he remember that what does it matter he repeat gruff let he come forward prim is screaming hysterical behind me shes wrapped he skinny arms around me like a vice no katniss no you cant go prim let go i say harsh because this is upsetting me and i dont want to cry when they televise the replay of the reap tonight everyone will make note of my tear and ill be marked as an easy target a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let go i can feel someone pull he from my back i turn and see gale ha lift prim off the ground and shes thrash in his arms up you go catnip he say in a voice he fighting to keep steady and then he carry prim off toward my mother i steel myself and climb the steps well bravo gush effie trinket that the spirit of the game shes pleased to final have a district with a little action go on in it whats your name i swallow hard katniss everdeen i say i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want he to steal all the glory do we come on everybody let give a big round of applause to our new tribute trill effie trinket to the everlasting credit of the people of district 12 not one person clap not even the one holding betting slip the one who are usual beyond caring possibly because they know me from the hob or knew my father or have encounter prim who noone can help loving so instead of acknowledge applause i stand there unmoving while they take part in the bold form of dissent they can manage silence which say we do not agree we do not condone all of this is wrong then something unexpected happen at least i dont expect it because i dont think of district 12 as a place that care about me but a shift ha occurred since i stepped up to take prim place and now it seem i have become someone precious at first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touch the three middle finger of their left hand to their lip and hold it out to me it is an old and rare used gesture of our district occasional seen at funeral it mean thank it mean admiration it mean goodbye to someone you love now i am truly in danger of cry but fortunate haymitch choose this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me look at he look at this one he holler throw an arm around my should he surprising strong for such a wreck i like he his breath reek of liquor and it been a long time since he bathe lot of he cant think of the word for a while spunk he say triumphantly more than you he release me and start for the front of the stage more than you he shout pointe direct into acamera is he address the audience or is he so drunk he might actual be taunting the capitol ill never know because just as he opening his mouthto continue haymitch plummet off the stage and knock himself unconscious he disgusting but im grateful with every camera gleeful trained on him i have just enough time to release the small choke sound in my throat and compose myself i put my hand behind my back and stare into the distance i can see the hill i climb this morning with gale for a moment i yearn for something the idea of us leave the district make our way in the woods but i know i was right about not running off because who else would have volunteer for prim haymitch is whisk away on a stretch and effie trinket is trying to get the ball roll again what an exciting day she warble as she attempt to straighten he wig which ha listed severe to the right but more excitement to come it time to choose our boy tribute clear hope to contain he tenuous hair situate she plant one hand on he head as she cross to the ball that contain the boy name and grab the first slip she encounter she zip back to the podium and i dont even have time to wishfor gale safety when shes reade the name peeta mellark peeta mellark oh no i think not him because i recognize this name although i have never spoken direct to it owner peeta mellark no the odd are not in my favor today i watch him as he make his way toward the stage medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that fall in wave over his forehead the shock of the moment is register on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eye show the alarm ive seen so often in prey yet he climb steady onto the stage and takes his place effie trinket ask for volunteer but no one steps forward he ha two old broth i know ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont this is standard family devote only goes so far for most people on reap day what i did was the radical thing the mayor begin to read the long dull treaty of treason as he does every year at this point it require but im not listen to a word why him i think then i try to convince myself it doesnt matter peeta mellark and i are not friend not even neighbors we dont speak our only real interaction happen year ago he probably forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will it was during the worst time my father had beenkilled in the mine accident three months early in the bitter january anyone could remember the numb of his loss had passe and the pain would hit me out of nowhere double me over rack my body with sob where are you i would cry out in my mind where have you gone of course there was never any answer the district had given us a small amount of money as compensate for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do anything but sit propped up in achair or more often huddle under the blanket on he bed eye fixed on some point in the distance once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into still no amount of pleading from prim seem to affect he i was terrify i suppose now that my mother was locke in some dark world of sad but at the time all i knew was that i had lost not only a father but a mother as well at eleven year old with prim just seven i took over as head of the family there was no choice i bought our food at the market and cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and myself look presentablebecause if it had become known that my mother could no longe care for us the district would have taken us away from he and placed us in the community home id grown up seeing those home kid at school the sad the mark of angry hand on their faces the hopeless that curled their should forward i could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim who cry when i cry before she even knew the reason who brush and plait my moth hair before we left for school who still polish my father shave mirror each night because he hate the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the seam the community home would crush he like a bug so i kept our predicament a secret but the money ran out and we were slow starve to death there no other way to put it i kept telling myself if i could only hold out until may just may 8th i would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us only there were still several week to go we could well be dead by then starvation not an uncommon fate in district 12 who hasnt seen the victim old people who cant work children from a family with too many to feed those injured in the mine straggle through the street and one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall orly in the meadow you hear the wail from a house and the peacekeeper are called in to retrieve the body starvation is never the cause of death officially it always the flu or exposure or pneumonia but that fool no one on the afternoon of my encounter with peeta mellark the rain was fall in relentless icy sheet i had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby cloth of prim in the public market but there were no take although i had been to the hob on several occasion with my father i was too frighten to venture into that rough gritty place alone the rain had soak through my father hunt jacket leave me chill to the bone for three day wed had nothing but boil water with some old dried mint leave id found in the back of a cupboard by the time the market closed i was shake so hard i dropped my bundle of baby cloth in a mud puddle i didnt pick it up for fear i would keel over and be unable to regain my feet beside no onewanted those cloth i couldnt go home because at home was my mother with he dead eye and my little sister with he hollow cheek and crack lip i couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branch i had scavenge atthe edge of the woods aft the coal had run out my band empty of any hope i found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shop that serve the wealthy townspeople the merchant live above their business so i was essential in their backyard i remember the outline of garden bed not yet planted for the spring a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunch defeat in the muck all form of steal are forbidden in district 12 punishable by death but it crosse my mind that there might be something in the trash bin and those were fair game perhaps a bone at the butch or rotted vegetable at the grocer something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat unfortunate the bin had just been empty when i passe the bake the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming i felt dizzy the oven were in the back and a golden glow spill out the open kitchen door i stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfere running it icy finger down my back force me back to life i lift the lid to the bake trash bin and found it spotless heartless bare sudden a voice was screaming at me and i look up to see the bake wife telling me to move on and did i want he to call the peacekeeper andhow sick she was of have those brat from the seam paw through he trash the word were ugly and i had no defense as i careful replaced the lid and backed away i noticed him a boy with blond hair peer out from behind his moth back id seen him at school he was in my year but i didnt know his name he stuck with the town kid so how would i his mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watch me as i made my way behind the pen that held their pig and lean against the far side of an old apple tree the realization that id have nothing to take home had final sunk in my knee buckle and i slid down the tree trunk to it root it was too much i was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired let them call the peacekeeper and take us to the community home i thought or better yet let me die right here in the rain there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and i vague wonder what was go on feet slosh toward me through the mud and i thought it he shes come to drive me away with a stick but it wasnt he it was the boy in his arms he carrie two large loaves of bread that must have fall into the fire because the crust were scorch black his mother was yell feed it to the pig you stupid creaturewhy not no one decent will buy burned bread he began to tear off chunk from the burned part andtoss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappear to help a customer the boy never even glance my way but i was watch him because of the bread because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone what had she hit him with my parent never hit us i couldnt even imagine it the boy took one look back to the bakery as if check that the coast was clear then his attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction the second quick follow and he slosh back to the bakery close the kitchen door tight behind him i stare at the loaves in disbelief they were fine perfect real except for the burned area did he mean for me to have them he must have because there they were at my feet before anyone could witness what had happen i shove the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunt jacket tight about me and walk swift away the heat of the bread burned into my skin but i clutch it tight cling to life by the time i reach home the loaves had cooled somewhatbut the inside were still warm when i dropped them on the table prim hand reach to tear off a chunk but i made he sit forced my mother to join us at the table and pour warm tea i scrape off the black stuff and slice the bread we ate an entire loaf slice by slice it was good hearty bread filled with raisin and nut i put my cloth to dry at the fire crawl into bed and fell into a dreamless sleep it didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose might have dropped the loaves into the flame knowing it meant bee punished and then deliver them to me but i dismiss this it must have been an accident why would he have done it he didnt even know me still just throw me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have sure result in a beat if discovered 1 couldnt explain his actions we ate slice of bread for breakfast and head to school it was as if spring had come overnight warm sweet air fluffy cloud at school i passe the boy in the hall his cheek had swell up and his eye had blacken he was with his friend and didnt acknowledge me in any way but as i collected prim and start for home that afternoon i found him staring at me from across the school yard our eye met for only a second then he turn his headaway i dropped my gaze embarrassed and that when i saw it the first dandelion of the year a bell went off in my head i thought of the hour spent in the woods with my father and i knew how we were go to survive to this day i can never shake the connection between this boy peeta mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me that i was not doom and more than once i have turn in the school hallway and caught his eye trained on me only to quick flit away i feel like i owe him something and i hate owe people maybe if ihad thank him at some point id be feeling less conflict now i thought about it a couple of time but the opportunity never seem to present itself and now it never will because were go to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death exact how am i supposed to work in a thankyou in there somehow it just wont seem sincere if im trying to slit his throat the mayor finish the dreary treaty of treason and mote for peeta and me to shake hand his are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread peeta look me right in the eye and give my hand what i think is meant to be a reassure squeeze maybe it just a nervous spasm we turn back toface the crowd as the anthem of panem play oh well i think there will be twentyfour of us odd are someone else will kill him before i do of course the odd have not been very dependable of late3the moment the anthem end we are taken into custody i dont mean were handcuff or anything but a group of peacekeeper march us through the front door of the justice building maybe tribute have tried to escape in the past ive never seen that happen though once inside im conduct to a room and left alone it the rich place ive ever been in with thick deep carpet and a velvet couch and chair i know velvet because my mother ha a dress with a collar made of the stuff when i sit on the couch i cant help running my finger over the fabric repeated it help to calm me as i try to prepare for the next hour the time allotted for the tribute to say goodbye to their loved one i cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eye and a red nose cry is not an option there will be morecameras at the train station my sister and my mother come first i reach out to primand she climb on my lap he arms around my neck headon my shoulder just like she did when she was a toddle my mother sit beside me and wraps he arms around us for a few minute we say nothing then i start telling themall the the they must remember to do now that i will not be there to do them for them prim is not to take any tesserae they can get by iftheyre careful on selle prim goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the seam gale will get he the herb she doesnt grow herself but she must be very careful to describe them because he not as familiar with them as i am hell also bring them game he and i made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensate but they should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine i dont bother suggest prim learn to hunt i tried to teach he a couple of time and it was disastrous the woods terrify he and whenever i shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough but she make out well with he goat so i concentrate on that when i am done with instruction about fueland trade and stay in school i turn to my mother and grip he arm hard listen to me are you listen to me she nod alarm by my intensity she must know whats come you cant leave again i say my moth eye find the floor i know i wont i couldnt help what well you have to help it this time you cant clock out and leave prim on he own there no me now to keep you both alive it doesnt matter what happen whatever you see on the screen you have to promise me youll fight through it my voice ha risen to a shout in it is all the anger all the fear i felt at he abandonment she pull he arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now i was ill i could have treated myself if id had the medicine i have now that part about he bee ill might be true ive seen he bring back people suffer from immobilizing sad since perhaps it is a sickness but it one we cant afford then take it and take care of he i say ill be all right katniss say prim clasp my face in he hand but you have to take care too you so fast and brave maybe you can win i cant win prim must know that in he heart the competition will be far beyond my abilities kid from wealthy district where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole live for this boy who are two to three time my size girl

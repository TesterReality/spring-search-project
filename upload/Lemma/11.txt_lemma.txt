disposaljust be ready for supper in an hour i peel off my moth blue dress and take a hot shower ive never had a shower before it like bee in a summer rain only warm i dress in a dark green shirt and pant at the last minute i remembermadges little gold pin for the first time i get a good look at it it as if someone fashion a small golden bird and then attached a ringaround it the bird is connected to the ring only by it wing tip i sudden recognize it a mocking jay theyrefunny bird and something of a slap in the face to the capitol during the rebellion the capitol bred a series of genetically altered animal as weapon the common term for them was muttations or sometime mutt for short one was a special bird called a jabber jay that hadthe ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversation they were home bird exclusive male that were released into region where the capitol enemy were known to be hide aft the bird gather word theyd fly back to cent to be recorded it took people awhile to realize what wasgoing on in the district how private conversation were bee transmitted then of course the rebel fed the capitol endless lie and the joke was on it so the cent were shut down and the bird were abandon to die off in the wild only they didnt die off insteadthe jabber jay mated with female mockingbird create a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistle and human melody they had lost the ability to enunciate word but could still mimic a range of human vocal sound from a child highpitched warble to a man deep tone andthey could recreate song not just a few note but whole songswith multiple verse if you had the patience to sing them and if they like your voice my father was particular fond of mockingjays when we went hunt he would whistle or sing complicated song to them and aftera politepause theyd always sing back not everyone is treated with such respect but whenever my father sang all the bird in the area would fall silent and listen his voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cryat the same time i could never bring myself to continue the practice aft he was gone still there something comforting about the little bird it like have a piece of my father with me protect me i fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabricas a background i can almost imagine the mockingjay fly through the tree effie trinket come to collect me for supper i follow he through the narrow rock corridor into a dine room with polish panel wall there a table where all the dish are high breakable peeta mellark sitswaiting for us the chair next to him empty where haymitch ask effie trinket bright last time i saw him he said he was go to take a nap say peeta well it been anexhausting day say effie trinket i think shes relieved by haymitchs absence and who can blameher the supper come in courses a thick carrot soup green salad lamb chop and mash potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake throughout the meal effie trinket keep reminding us to save space because there more to come but im stuff myself because ive never had food like thisso good and so much and because probably the best thing i can do between now and the game is put on a few pound at least you two have decent mann say effie as were finish the main course the pair last year ate everything with their hand likea couple of savage it complete upset my digestion the pair last year were two kid from the seam whod never not one day of their live had enough to eat and when they did have food table mann were sure the last thing on their mind peetas a bakersson my mother taught prim and i to eat proper so yes i can handle a fork and knife but i hate effie trinket comment so much i make a point of eat the rest of my meal with my finger then i wipe my hand on the tablecloth thismakes he purse he lip tight together now that the meal over im fighting to keep the food down i can see peetas look a little green too neither of ourstomachs is used to such rich fare but if i can hold down greasy saes concoction of mice meat pigentrails and tree bark a winter specialty im determined to hang on to this we go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reap across panem they try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people inthe capitol could real do that since none of them have to attend reap themselves one by one we see the other reap the name called the volunteer stepping forward or more often not we examine the faces of the kid who will be our competition a few stand out my mind amonstrous boy who lunge forward to volunteer from district 2 a foxfaced girl with sleek red hair from district 5 a boy with a cripple foot from district 10 and most haunting a twelveyearold girl from district 11 she ha dark brown skin and eye but otherthan that shes very like prim in size and demeanor only when she mount the stage and they ask for volunteer all you can hear is the wind whistle through the decrepit build around he there no one willing to take he place last of all they show district

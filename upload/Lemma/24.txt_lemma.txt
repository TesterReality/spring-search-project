someof the merchant were a little generous in their trade but i always attributed that to their longstanding relationship with my father beside my game is firstclass no one pity me i glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me aft about a minute of this haymitch sayswell then well well well katniss there no guarantee theyll be bows and arrow in the arena but during your private session with the gamemakers show them what you can do until then stay clear of archery are you any good at trapping i know a few basic snare imutter that may be significant in term of food say haymitch and peeta shes right never underestimate strength in the arena very often physical power tilt the advantage to a player in the train cent they will have weight but dont reveal how much you can lift in frontof the other tribute the plan the same for both of you you go to group train spend the time trying to learn something you dont know throw a spear swing a mace learn to tie a decent knot save show what you best at until your private session arewe clear say haymitch peeta and i nod one last thing in public i want you by each other side every minute say haymitch we both start to object but haymitch slam his hand on the table every minute it not open for discussion you agree to do as isaid you will be together you will appear amiable to each other now get out meet effie at the elevator at ten for train i bite my lip and stalk back to my room make sure peeta can hear the door slam i sit on the bed hate haymitch hatingpeeta hate myself for mentioningthat day long ago in the rain it such a joke peeta and i go along pretending to be friend talk up each other strengths insist the other take credit for their abilities because in fact at some point were go to have to knock itoff and acceptwere bitter adversary which id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in train it my own fault i guess for telling him he didnt have to coach us separate but that didnt mean i wanted to doeverything with peeta who by the way clear doesnt want to be partner up with me either i hear peetas voice in my head she ha no idea the effect she can have obvious meant to demean me right but a tiny part of me wonder if this was acompliment that he meant i was appealing in some way it weird how much he noticed me like the attention he paid to my hunt and apparently i have not been as oblivious to him as i imagine either the flour the wrestle i have kept track of the boywith the bread it almost ten i clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again anger temporary block out my nervous about meet the other tribute but now i can feel my anxiety rise again by the time i meet effie and peeta at the elevator i catch myselfbiting my nail i stop at once the actual train room are below ground level of our building with these elevator the ride is less than a minute the doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapon and obstacle courses although it not yet ten were the lastones to arrive the other tribute are gather in a tense circle they each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirt while someone pin the number 12 on my back i do a quick assessment peeta and i are the only two dressedalike as soon as we join the circle the head train a tall athletic woman named atala steps up and begin to explain the train schedule expert in each skill will remain at their state we will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per ourmentors instruction some of the state teach survival skill other fighting technique we are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute there are assistant on hand if we want to practice with a partner when atala begin to read down the list of the skill state myeyes cant help flitting around to the other tribute it the first time weve been assembled on level ground in simple cloth my heart sink almost all of the boy and at least half of the girl are bigger than i am even though many of the tribute have neverbeen fed proper you can see it in their bone their skin the hollow look in their eye i may be small natural but overall my familys resourceful ha given me an edge in that area i stand straight and while im thin im strong themeat and plant from thewoods combine with the exertion it tookto get them have given me a healthy body than most of those i see around me the exception are the kid from the wealthy district the volunteer the one who have been fed and trained throughout their live for this moment the tributesfrom 1 2 and 4 traditional have this look about them it technical against the rule to train tribute before they reach the capitol but it happen every year in district 12 we call them the career tribute or just the career and like as not the winner will beone of them the slight advantage i held come into the train cent my fiery entrance last night seem to vanish in the presence of my competition the other tribute were jealous of us but not because we were amazing because our stylist were now i see nothing but

up
here Why dont you come on up Think I will says the same boy Here take this Cato says the girl from District 1 and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows My bow My arrows Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want
to scream at myself at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them I try to make eye contact with him now but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edgeof his shirt No says Cato pushing away the bow Ill
do better with my sword I can see the weapon a short heavy blade at his belt I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the
slenderest limb Part of its my weight but part of its practice You have to know where to place your hands and feet Im another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down He
hits the ground hard and Im hoping he possibly broke his neckwhen he gets back to his feet swearing like a fiend The girl with the arrows Glimmer I hear someone call her ugh the names the people in District 1 give their children are so ridiculous anyway Glimmer scales
the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop Im at least eighty feet high now She tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree
near me though and Im able to seize it I wave it teasingly above her head as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance I could kill them everyone of them if those silver weapons
were in my hands The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves furious I have made them look foolish But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing Finally I hear Peeta say harshly Oh let her stay up
there Its not like shes going anywhere Well deal with her in the morning Well hes right about one thing Im going nowhere All the relief from the pool water has gone leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns I scoot down to a fork in the
tree and clumsily prepare for bed Put on my jacket Lay out my sleeping bed Belt myself in and try to keep frommoaning The heat of the bags too much for my leg I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air I
drizzle water on the wound my hands All my bravado is gone Im weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat Even if I can last the night what will the morning bring I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns
forbid it Birds are settling down for the night singing lullabies to their young Night creatures emerge An owl hoots The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the
Careers torches Suddenly Im up on one elbow Those are no possums eyes I know their glassy reflection too well In fact those are not animal eyes at all In the last dim rays of light I make her out watching me silently from between the branches Rue How long
has she been here The whole time probably Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her Perhaps she headed up her treeshortly before I did hearing the pack was so close For a while we hold each others gaze Then without even rustling a leaf her little hand slides
into the open andpoints to something above my head14My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me At first I have no idea what shes pointing to but then about fifteen feet up I make out the vague shape in the dimming light But of
   Of what Some sort of animal It looks about the size of a raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch swaying ever so slightly Theres something else Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my ears register a low hum Then I know
Its a wasp nest Fear shoots through me but I have enough sense to keep still After all I dont know what kind of wasp lives there It could be the ordinary leaveusaloneandwellleaveyoualone type But these are the Hunger Games and ordinary isnt the norm More likely they will be
one of the Capitols muttations tracker jackers Like the jabberjays these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like land mines around the districts during the war Larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive solid gold body and asting that raises a lump the size of
a plum on contact Most people cant tolerate more than a few stings Some die at once If you live the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness And theres another thing these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to
kill them Thats where the tracker part of the name comes from After the war the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city but the ones near the districts were left untouched Another reminder of our weakness I suppose just like the Hunger Games Another reason to keep

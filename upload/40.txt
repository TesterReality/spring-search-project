be
able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration but after that Ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week tops Icarefully lay out the provisions One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal A pack of crackers A pack of dried beef strips A bottle of iodine
A box of wooden matches A small coil of wire A pair of sunglasses And a halfgallon plasticbottle with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry No water How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle I become aware of the dryness in my
throat and mouth the cracks in my lips Ive been moving all day long Its been hot and Ive sweat a lot I do this at home but there are always streams to drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it As I refill my pack
I have an awful thought The lake The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound What if thats the only water source in the arena That way theyll guarantee drawing us in to fight The lake is a full days journey from where I sit
now a much harder journey with nothing to drink And then even if I reach it its sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes Im about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today It has to drink too I just have to
find out where Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease The trees are too thin to offer much concealment The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water And Im still heading downhill deeper
and deeper into a valley that seems endless Im hungry too but I dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet Instead I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of
the softer inner bark I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along After a week of the finest food in the world its a little hard to choke down But Ive eaten plenty of pine in my life Ill adjust quickly In another hour its clear Ive got to
find a place to camp Night creatures are coming out I can hear the occasional hoot or howl my first clue that Ill be competing with natural predators for the rabbits As to whether Ill be viewed as a source of food its too soon to tell There could be
any number of animals stalking me at this moment But right now I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority Im sure many will continue hunting through the night Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food an abundance of water from the lake torches or
flashlights and weapons theyre itching to use I can only hope Ive traveled far and fast enough to be out of range Before settling down I take my wire and set two twitchup snares in the brush I know its risky to be setting traps but food will go so
fast out here And I cant set snares on the run Still I walk another five minutes before making camp I pick my tree carefully A willow not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows offering concealment in those long flowing tresses I climb up sticking to
the strongerbranches close tothe trunk and find a sturdy fork for my bed It takes some doing but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner I place my backpack in the foot of the bag then slide in after it As a precaution I remove my belt
loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist Now if I roll over in my sleep I wont go crashing to the ground Im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head but I put on
my hood as well As night falls the air is cooling quickly Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack I know now it was the right choice This sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my body heat will be invaluable Im sure there are several other tributes whose
biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep If only I wasnt so thirsty    Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap Through the branches I can
see the seal of the Capitol which appears to be floating in the sky Im actually viewing another screen an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment At home we would be watching full
coverage of each and every killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes For instance if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone my secret would be revealed to all No here in the arena all we see are the same photographs
they showed when they televised our training scores Simple head shots But now instead of scores they post only district numbers I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers The first to appear is
the girl from District 3 That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived No surprise there Then the boy from 4 I didnt expect that one usually all the Careers make it through the first day The boy from District 5

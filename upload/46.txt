whole
segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks Somewhere in a cool and spotless room a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second All that is needed is a
direct hit Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs Each one is only the size of an apple but packs tremendous power on contact Every sense I have goes into
overdrive as the need to survive takes over Theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one When theres a hiss I act or die Something keeps me moving forward though A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena
are rigged for certain attacks And that if I can just get away from this section I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers but I cant worry about that now How long I scramble
along dodging the fireballs I cant say but the attacks finally begin to abate Which is good because Im retchingagain This time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well Im forced to stop as my body convulses trying desperately to
rid itself of the poisons Ive been sucking in during the attack I wait for the next hiss the next signal to bolt It doesnt come The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes My clothes are drenched in sweat Somehow through the smoke and
vomit I pick up the scent of singed hair My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers I stare at them fascinated by the transformation when the hissing registers My muscles
react only not fast enoughthis time The fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not before it skids across my right calf Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet shrieking trying to remove myself
from the horror When I finally regain enough sense I roll the leg back and forth on the ground which stifles the worst of it But then without thinking I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands I sit on the ground a few yards from the blazeset
off by the fireball My calf is screaming my hands covered in red welts Im shaking too hard to move If the Gamemakers want to finish me off now is the time I hear Cinnas voice carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems Katniss the girl who was on
fire What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one Perhaps Cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me I know he couldnt have foreseen this must be hurting for me because in fact I believe he cares about me But all in
all maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me The attack is now over The Gamemakers dont want me dead Not yet anyway Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong The real sport of the Hunger Games is
watching the tributes kill one another Every so often they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can But mostly they manipulate us into confronting one another facetoface Which means if I am no longer being fired at there is at least one other tribute close at
hand I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky It does not seem to be
pursuing me any longer exceptwith its stinking black clouds Another light daylight begins to softly emerge Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams My visibility is poor I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction A tribute could easily be concealed from me here I should draw my knife as
a precaution but I doubt my ability to hold it for long The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf I hate burns have always hated them even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven It is
the worst kind of pain to me but I have never experienced anything like this Im so weary I dont even notice Im in the pool until Im ankledeep Its springfed bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks and blissfully cool I plunge my hands into the shallow
water and feel instant relief Isnt that what my mother always says The first treatment for a burn is cold water That it draws out the heat But she means minor burns Probably shed recommend it for my hands But what of my calf Although I have not yet had
the courage to examine it Im guessing that its an injury in a whole different class I lie on my stomach at edge of thepool for a while dangling my hands in the water examining the little flames onmy fingernails that are beginning to chip off Good Ive had enough
fire for a lifetime I bathe the blood and ash from my face I try to recall all I know about burns They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal Then there are the mine accidents    A family

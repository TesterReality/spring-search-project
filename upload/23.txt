them
hope or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twentyfour tributes circled together knowing only one could live Haymitch and Peeta come in bid me good morning fill their plates It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am I need
to say something to Cinna This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin Surely they must know this Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do If it was anyone but Cinna I might be
tempted to ignore him But after last nights triumph I dont have a lot of room to criticize his choices Im nervous about the training There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together On the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform in private
before the Gamemakers The thought of meeting the other tributesfacetoface makes me queasy I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands but my appetite is gone When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew he pushes back his plate with a
sigh He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table So lets get down to business Training First off if you like Ill coach you separately Decide now Why would you coach us separately I ask Say if
you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about says Haymitch I exchange a look with Peeta I dont have any secret skills he says And I already know what yours is right I mean Ive eaten enough of your squirrels I never thought about
Peeta eating the squirrels I shot Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself Not out of greed But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat Beef and chicken and horse You can coach us together I tell Haymitch Peeta nods All
right so give me some idea of what you can do says Haymitch I cant doanything says Peeta Unless you count baking bread Sorry I dont Katniss I already know youre handy with a knife says Haymitch Not really But I can hunt I say With a bow and arrow
And youre good asks Haymitch I have to think about it Ive been putting food on the table for four years Thats no small task Im not as good as my father was but hed had more practice Ive better aim than Gale but Ive had more practice Hes a
genius with traps and snares Im all right I say Shes excellent says Peeta My father buys her squirrels He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body She hits every one in the eye Its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher She can even
bring down deer This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise First that he ever noticed Second that hes talking me up What are you doing I ask him suspiciously What are you doing If hes going to help you he has to know what youre
capable of Dont underrate yourself says Peeta I dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way What about you Ive seen you in the market You can lift hundredpound bags of flour I snap at him Tell him that Thats not nothing Yes and Im sure the arena
will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people Its not like being able to use a weapon You know it isnt he shoots back He can wrestle I tell Haymitch He came in second in our school competition last year only after his brother What
use is that How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death says Peeta in disgust Theres always handtohand combat All you need is to come up with a knife and youll at least stand a chance If I get jumped Im dead I can hear my voice
rising in anger But you wont Youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows You know what my mother said to me when she came to saygoodbye as if to cheer me up she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a
winner Then I realized she didnt mean me she meant you bursts out Peeta Oh she meant you I say with a wave of dismissal She said Shes a survivor that one She is says Peeta That pulls me up short Did his mother really say that about me Did
she rate me over her son I see the pain in Peetas eyes and know he isnt lying Suddenly Im behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back the hollowness in my belly I sound eleven years old when I speak But
only because someone helped me Peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands and Iknow he remembers that day too But he just shrugs People will help you in the arena Theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you No more than you I say Peeta rolls
his eyes at Haymitch She has no idea The effect she can have He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table refusing to look at me What on earth does he mean People help me When we were dying of starvation no one helped me No one
except Peeta Once I had something to barter with things changed Im a tough trader Or am I What effect do I have That Im weak and needy Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me I try to think if this is true Perhaps

worth
a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person You may do this for each of your family members as well So at the age of twelve I had my name entered four times Once because I had to and three times for tesserae for grain and oil
for myself Prim and my mother In fact every year I have needed to do this And the entries are cumulative So now at the age of sixteen my name will be in thereaping twenty times Gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or singlehandedly feeding a family
of five for seven years will have his name in fortytwo times You can see why someone like Madge who has never been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live
in the Seam Not impossible but slim And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol not the districts certainly not Madges family its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected On other days
deep in the woods Ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust
one another Its to the Capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine If it wasnt reaping day If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what Im sure she thought was a
harmless comment As we walk I glance over at Gales face still smoldering underneath his stony expression His rages seem pointless to me although I never say so Its not that I dont agree with him I do But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of
the woods It doesnt change anything It doesnt make things fair It doesnt fill our stomachs In fact it scares off the nearby game I let him yell though Better he does it in the woods than in the district Gale and I divide our spoils leaving two fish a
couple of loaves of good bread greens a quart of strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for each See you in the square I say Wear somethingpretty he says flatly At home I find my mother and sister are ready to go My mother wears a fine dress
from her apothecary days Prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and ruffled blouse Its a bit big on her but my mother has made it stay with pins Even so shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back A tub of warm water waits
for me I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair To my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me A soft blue thing with matching shoes Are you sure I ask Im trying to get past
rejecting offers of help from her For a while I was so angry I wouldnt allow her to do anything for me And this is something special Her clothes from herpast are very precious to her Of course Lets put your hair up too she says I let her toweldry
it and braid it up on my head I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall You look beautiful says Prim in a hushed voice And nothing like myself I say I hug her because I know these next few hours will be terrible
for her Her first reaping Shes about as safe as you can get since shes only entered once I wouldnt let her take out any tesserae But shes worried about me That the unthinkable might happen I protect Prim in every way I can but Im powerless against the reaping
The anguish I always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ace I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm Tuck your tail in little duck I say smoothing
the blouse back in place Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack Quack yourself I say with a light laugh The kind only Prim can draw out of me Come on lets eat I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head The fish and
greens are already cooking in a stew but that will be for supper We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal to make it special we say Instead we drink milk from Prims goat Lady and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain
although no one has much appetite anyway At one oclock we head for the square Attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door This evening officials will come around and check to see if this is the case If not youll be imprisoned Its too bad really that they
hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant The squares surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if theres good weather it has a holiday feel to it But today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings
theres an air of grimness The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect People file in silently and sign in The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well Twelve through eighteenyearolds are herded into roped

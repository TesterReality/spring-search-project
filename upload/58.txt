 And slowly it begins to dawn on me    Youd have thought the very ground was going to explode Its mined I whisper That explains everything The Careers willingness to leave their supplies Foxfaces reaction the involvement of the boy from District 3 where they have the
factories where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives But where did he get them In the supplies Thats not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of
the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them Ive
never seen anyone in the Games do that I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers Well hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over on them but what am I supposed to do now Obviously I cant go strolling into that mess without
blowing myself skyhigh As for sending in a burning arrow thats more laughable than ever The mines are set off by pressure It doesnt have to be a lot either One year a girldropped her token a small wooden ball while she was at her plate and they literally had
to scrape bits of her off the ground My arms pretty good I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what Maybe one mine That could start a chain reaction Or could it Would the boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such
a way that a single mine would not disturb the others Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader Even if I only blew up one mine Id draw the Careers back down on me for sure And anyway what am I thinking Theres that net clearly
strung to deflect any such attack Besides what Id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once setting off a big chain reaction demolishing the whole lot I glance back up at the woods The smoke from Rues second fire is wafting toward the sky By
now the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick Time is running out There is a solution to this I know there is if I can only focus hard enough I stare at the pyramid thebins the crates too heavy to topple over with an arrow Maybe
one contains cooking oil and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since Id just be guessing Im genuinely thinking of trying to recreate Foxfaces trip up to the
pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples I could sever the rope in one shot didnt I do as much in the Training Center Its a big bag but it still might only be good for one
explosion If only I could free the apples themselves    I know what to do I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done I place my feet carefully block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim The first
arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top leaving a split in the burlap The second widens it to a gaping hole I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the
bag For a moment everything seems frozen in time Then the apples spill to the ground and Im blown backward into the air17The impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain knocks the wind out of meMy backpack does little to soften the blow Fortunately my quiver has caught in
the crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp The ground still shakes with explosions I cant hear them I cant hear anything at the moment But the apples must have set off enough mines causing debris to activate the
others I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter some of it burning rain down around me An acrid smoke fills the air which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe After about a minute the ground
stops vibrating I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid The Careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that Id better get out of here I think Theyll be making a beeline for the
place But once Im on my feet I realize escape may not be so simple Im dizzy Not the slightly wobbly kind but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet I take a few steps and somehow
wind up on my hands and knees I wait a few minutes to let it pass but it doesnt Panic begins to set in I cant stay here Flight is essential But I can neither walk nor hear I place a hand to my left ear theone that was turned
toward the blast and it comes away bloody Have I gone deaf from the explosion The idea frightens me I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter maybe more at times But I cant let my fear show Absolutely positively I am live on

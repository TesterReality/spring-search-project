Just be ready for supper in an hour I peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower Ive never had a shower before Its like being in a summer rain only warmer I dress in a dark green shirt and pants At the last minute I remember
Madges little gold pin For the first time I get a good look at it Its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ringaround it The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips I suddenly recognize it A mocking jay Theyre
funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol During the rebellion the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons The common term for them was muttations or sometimes mutts for short One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had
the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations They were homing birds exclusively male that were released into regions where the Capitols enemies were known to be hiding After the birds gathered words theyd fly back to centers to be recorded It took people awhile to realize what was
going on in the districts how private conversations were being transmitted Then of course the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies and the joke was on it So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild Only they didnt die off Instead
the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a childs highpitched warble to a mans deep tones And
they could recreate songs Not just a few notes but whole songswith multiple verses if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice My father was particularly fond of mockingjays When we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and after
a politepause theyd always sing back Not everyone is treated with such respect But whenever my father sang all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen His voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry
at the same time I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone Still theres something comforting about the little bird Its like having a piece of my father with me protecting me I fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric
as a background I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper I follow her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls Theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable Peeta Mellark sits
waiting for us the chair next to him empty Wheres Haymitch asks Effie Trinket brightly Last time I saw him he said he was going to take a nap says Peeta Well its been anexhausting day says Effie Trinket I think shes relieved by Haymitchs absence and who can blame
her The supper comes in courses A thick carrot soup green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake Throughout the meal Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come But Im stuffing myself because Ive never had food like this
so good and so much and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds At least you two have decent manners says Effie as were finishing the main course The pair last year ate everything with their hands like
a couple of savages It completely upset my digestion The pair last year were two kids from the Seam whod never not one day of their lives had enough to eat And when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds Peetas a bakers
son My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly so yes I can handle a fork and knife But I hate Effie Trinkets comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth This
makes her purse her lips tightly together Now that the meals over Im fighting to keep the food down I can see Peetas looking a little green too Neither of ourstomachs is used to such rich fare But if I can hold down Greasy Saes concoction of mice meat pig
entrails and tree bark a winter specialty Im determined to hang on to this We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people in
the Capitol could really do that since none of them have to attend reapings themselves One by one we see the other reapings the names called the volunteers stepping forward or more often not We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition A few stand out
in my mind Amonstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2 A foxfaced girl with sleek red hair from District 5 A boy with a crippled foot from District 10 And most hauntingly a twelveyearold girl from District 11 She has dark brown skin and eyes but other
than that shes very like Prim in size and demeanor Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her Theres no one willing to take her place Last of all they show District

But
he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live Still seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed him to live at all All four tributes seem to
still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack Even from here I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they did not known about the leaves that healed them Apparently whatever medicines they found in
the Cornucopia have been ineffective The Cornucopia sits in its original position but its insides have been picked clean Most of the supplies held in crates burlap sacks and plastic bins are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp Others are sprinkled around
the perimeter of the pyramid almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games A canopy of netting that aside from discouraging birds seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself The whole setup is completely perplexing The distance the netting and the presence
of the boy from District 3 One things for sure destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks Some other factor is at play here and Id better stay put until I figure out what it is My guess is the pyramid is boobytrapped in
some manner I think of concealed pits descending nets a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart Really thepossibilities are endless While I am mulling over my options I hear Cato shout out Hes pointing up to the woods far beyond me and without turning I
knowthat Rue must have set the first campfire Wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable The Careers begin to arm themselves at once An argument breaks out Its loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District
3 should stay or accompany them Hes coming We need him in the woods and his jobs done here anyway No one can touch those supplies says Cato What about Lover Boy says the boy from District 1 I keep telling you forget about him I know where I cut
him Its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet At any rate hes in no shape to raid us says Cato So Peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers Come on says
Cato He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District 3 and they head off in the direction of the fire The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying When we find her I kill her in my own way and no
one interferes Somehow I dont think hes talking about Rue She didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him I stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supplies The one advantage I have with the bow and arrow
is distance I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough Im a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch More likely itd just burn itself out and then what Id have achieved nothing and given
them far too much information about myself That I was here that I have an accomplice that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy Theres no alternative Im going to have to get in closer and see if I cant discover what exactly protects the supplies In fact
Im just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye Several hundred yards to my right I see someone emerge from the woods For a second I think its Rue but then I recognize Foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain
When she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid she stops searches the ground and carefully places her feet on a spot Then she begins to approach the pyramid with
strange little hops sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightlysometimes risking a few steps At one point she launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes But she overshot slightly and her momentum throws her forward I hear her give a sharp squeal
as her hands hit the ground but nothing happens In a moment shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies So Im right about the booby trap but its clearly more complex than I had imagined I was right about the girl too
How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly She fills herpack taking a few items from a variety of containers crackers from a crate a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a
rope off the side of a bin But only a handful from each not enough to tip off that the food is missing Not enough to cause suspicion And then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again safe and sound
I realize Im grinding my teeth in frustration Foxface has confirmed what Id already guessed But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity Has so many trigger points Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth Youd have thought

Chickens are too expensive but I could make do with a wild turkey Id need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange Goats milk would have to substitute for cream We can grow peas in the garden Id have to get wild onions from the woods I
dont recognize the grain our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker perhaps for two or three squirrels As for thepudding I cant even guess whats in it Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and
even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version What must it be like I wonder to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it
were so easy to come by What do they do all day these people in the Capitol besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment I look up and find Cinnas eyes trained on mine How despicable
we must seem to you he says Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts Hes right though The whole rotten lot of them is despicable No matter says Cinna So Katniss about your costume for the opening ceremonies My partner Portia is the stylist for
your fellow tribute Peeta And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes says Cinna As you know its customary to reflect the flavor of the district For the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry District 11 agriculture District 4 fishing
District 3 factories This means that coming from District 12 Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miners getupSince the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps One year our tributes were stark naked and
covered in black powder to represent coal dust Its always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd I prepare myself for the worst So Ill be in a coal miner outfit I ask hoping it wont be indecent Not exactly You see Portia and I think that
coal miner things very overdone No one will remember you in that And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable says Cinna Ill be naked for sure I think So rather than focus on the coal mining itself were going to focus on
the coal says Cinna Naked and covered in black dust I think And what do we do with coal We burn it says Cinna Youre not afraid of fire are you Katniss He sees my expression and grins A few hours later I am dressed in what will either be
the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies Im in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees But its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange yellowand red and the matching headpiece that define
this costume Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets Its not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with Youll be perfectly safe he says But Im not convinced I wont be perfectly barbecued by
the time we reach the citys center My face is relatively clear of makeup just a bit of highlighting here and there My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style I want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena
says Cinna dreamily Katniss the girl who was on fire It crosses my mind that Cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman Despite this mornings revelation about Peetas character Im actually relieved when he shows up dressed in an identical costume He should know about fire being a
bakers son and all His stylist Portia and her team accompany him in and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make Except Cinna He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations Were whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center which
is essentially a gigantic stable The opening ceremonies are about to start Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horsesOurs are coal black The animals are so well trained no one even needs to guide their reins Cinna and Portia direct us into the
chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the drape of our capes before moving off to consult with each other What do you think I whisper to Peeta About the fire Ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine he says through gritted teeth Deal I say Maybe
if we can get them off soon enough well avoid the worst burns Its bad though Theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in I know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said but I dont think he considered this angle Where is Haymitch
anyway Isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing says Peeta With all that alcohol in him its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame I say And suddenly were both laughing I guess were both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly
petrified of being turned into human torches were not acting sensibly The opening music begins Its easy to hear blasted around the Capitol Massive doors slide open revealing the crowdlined streets The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle where they will welcome us

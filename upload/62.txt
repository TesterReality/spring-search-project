I
crouch before her staring helplessly at the embedded weapon Theres no point in comforting words in telling her shell be all right Shes no fool Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline As if its me whos dying instead of Rue You blew up the food
she whispers Every last bit I say You have to win she says Im going to Going to win for both of us now I promise I hear a cannon and look up It must be for the boy from District 1 Dont go Rue tightens her grip on my
hand Course not Staying right here I say I move in closerto her pulling her head onto my lap I gently brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear Sing she says but I barely catch the word Sing I think Sing what I do know a few songs
Believe it or not there was once music in my house too Music I helped make My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but I havent sung much since he died Except when Prim is very sick Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a
baby Sing My throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke and fatigue But if this is Prims I mean Rues last request I have to at least try The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby one we sing fretful hungry babies to sleep with Its old
very old I think Made up long ago in our hills What my music teacher calls a mountain air But the words are easy and soothing promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today I give a small cough swallow hard and beginDeep
in the meadow under the willowA bed of grass a soft green pillowLay down your head and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open the sun will riseHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere
is the place where I love youRues eyes have fluttered shut Her chest moves but only slightly My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks But I have to finish the song for herDeep in the meadow hidden far awayA cloak of leaves a moonbeam rayForget your
woes and let your troubles layAnd when again its morning theyll wash awayHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmThe final lines are barely audibleHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love youEverythings still and quiet Then
almost eerily the mockingjays take up my song For a moment I sit there watching my tears drip down on her face Rues cannon fires I lean forward and press my lips against her temple Slowly as if not to wake her I lay her head back on the ground
and release her hand Theyll want me to clear out now So they can collect the bodies And theres nothing to stay for I roll the boy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack retrieve the arrow that ended his life I cut Rues pack from her
back as well knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft Ive no use for a spear so the sooner its gone from the arena the better I cant stop looking at Rue smaller than
ever a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting I cant bring myself to leave her like this Past harm but seeming utterly defenseless To hate the boy from District 1 who also appears so vulnerable in death seems inadequate Its the Capitol I hate for doing this
to all of us Gales voice is in my head His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless no longer to be ignored Rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty the injustice they inflict upon us But here even more strongly than at home
I feel my impotenceTheres no way to take revenge on the Capitol Is there Then I remember Peetas words on the roof Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capital they dont own me That Im more than just a
piece in their Games And for the first time I understand what he means I want to do something right here right now to shame them to make them accountable to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute
they cant own That Rue was more than a piece in their Games And so am I A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white I
gather up an armful and come back to Rues side Slowly one stem at a time I decorate her body in the flowers Covering the ugly wound Wreathing her face Weaving her hair with bright colors Theyll have to show it Or even if they choose to turn the cameras
elsewhere at this moment theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it I step back and take a last look at Rue She could really be asleep in that meadow after all Bye Rue I whisper
I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in herdirection Then I walk away without looking back The birds fall silent Somewhere a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft I dont know how it knows It must

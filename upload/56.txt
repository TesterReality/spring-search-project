too
Thats why I love your pin she says pointing to the mockingjay that Ive again forgotten about You have mockingjays I ask Oh yes I have a few that are my special friends We can sing back and forth for hours They carry messages for me she says What do
you mean I say Im usually up highest so Im the first to see the flag that signals quitting time Theres a special little song I do says Rue She opens her mouth and sings a little fournote run in a sweet clear voice And the mockingjays spread it around
the orchard Thats how everyone knows to knock off she continues They can be dangerous though if you get too near their nests But you cant blame them for that I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her Here you take it It has more meaning for you
than me Oh no says Rue closing my fingers back over the pin I like to see it on you Thats how I decided I could trust youBesides I have this She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt On it hangs a roughly
carved wooden star Or maybe its a flower Its a good luck charm Well its worked so far I say pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt Maybe you should just stick with that By lunch we have a plan By early afternoon we are poised to carry it out
I help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires the third shell have time for on her own We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together The stream should help guide me backto it Before I leave I make
sure Rues well stocked with food and matches I even insist she take my sleeping bag in case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall What about you Wont you be cold she asks Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake I say You know stealing
isnt illegal here I say with a grin At the last minute Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal the one she gives to indicate the days work is done It might not work But if you hear the mockingjays singing it youll know Im okay only I cant
get back right away Are there many mockingjays here I ask Havent you seen them Theyve got nests everywhere she says I have to admit I havent noticed Okay then If all goes according to plan Ill see you for dinner I say Unexpectedly Rue throws her arms around me
I only hesitate a moment before I hug her back You be careful she says to me You too I say I turn and head back to the stream feeling somehow worried About Rue being killed about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last
about leaving Rue alone about leaving Prim alone back home No Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry Rue has only me Once I reach the stream I have only to follow it downhill to the place I initially picked it
up after the tracker jacker attack I have to be cautious as I move along the water though because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions most of which concern Peeta The cannon that fired early this morning did that signify his death If so how did he die
At the hand of a Career And was that in revenge for letting me live I struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmers body when he burst through the trees But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened I must have been
moving very slowly yesterday because I reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it
My proximity to the Careers camp sharpens my senses and the closer I get to them the more guarded I am pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow I dont see any other tributes but I do notice some of
the things Rue has mentionedPatches of the sweet berries A bush with the leaves that healed my stings Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in And hereand there the blackandwhite flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head
When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot I pause a moment to gather my courage Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point Remember I tell myself Youre the hunter now not them I
get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness Its right at the edge of the wood but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the
Career camp without being spotted Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began There are four tributes The boy from District 1 Cato and the girl from District 2 and a scrawny ashenskinned boy who must be from District 3 He made almost no impression on me at
all during our time in the Capitol I can remember almost nothing about him not his costume not his training score not his interview Even now as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box hes easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions

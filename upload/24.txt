some
of the merchants were a little generous in their trades but I always attributed that to their longstanding relationship with my father Besides my game is firstclass No one pitied me I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me After about a minute of this Haymitch says
Well then Well well well Katniss theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during your private session with the Gamemakers show them what you can do Until then stay clear of archery Are you any good at trapping I know a few basic snares I
mutter That may be significant in terms of food says Haymitch And Peeta shes right never  underestimate strength in the arena Very often physical power tilts the advantage to a player In the Training Center they will have weights but dont reveal how much you can lift in front
of the other tributes The plans the same for both of you You go to group training Spend the time trying to learn something you dont know Throw a spear Swing a mace Learn to tie a decent knot Save showing what youre best at until your private sessions Are
we clear says Haymitch Peeta and I nod One last thing In public I want you by each others side every minute says Haymitch We both start to object but Haymitch slams his hand on the table Every minute Its not open for discussion You agreed to do as I
said You will be together you will appear amiable to each other Now get out Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training I bite my lip and stalk back to my room making sure Peeta can hear the door slam I sit on the bed hating Haymitch hating
Peeta hating myself for mentioningthat day long ago in the rain Its such a joke Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends Talking up each others strengths insisting the other take credit for their abilities Because in fact at some point were going to have to knock it
off and acceptwere bitter adversaries Which Id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for Haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training Its my own fault I guess for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately But that didnt mean I wanted to do
everything with Peeta Who by the way clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me either I hear Peetas voice in my head She has no idea The effect she can have Obviously meant to demean me Right but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a
compliment That he meant I was appealing in some way Its weird how much hes noticed me Like the attention hes paid to my hunting And apparently I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined either The flour The wrestling I have kept track of the boy
with the bread Its almost ten I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes but now I can feel my anxiety rising again By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator I catch myself
biting my nails I stop at once The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building With these elevators the ride is less than a minute The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses Although its not yet ten were the last
ones to arrive The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts While someone pins the number 12 on my back I do a quick assessment Peeta and I are the only two dressed
alike As soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule Experts in each skill will remain at their stations We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per our
mentors instructions Some of the stations teach survival skills others fighting techniques We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations my
eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes Its the first time weve been assembled on level ground in simple clothes My heart sinks Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am even though many of the tributes have never
been fed properly You can see it in their bones their skin the hollow look in their eyes I may be smaller naturally but overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area I stand straight and while Im thin Im strong Themeat and plants from the
woods combined with the exertion it tookto get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment The tributes
from 1 2 and 4 traditionally have this look about them Its technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year In District 12 we call them the Career Tributes or just the Careers And like as not the winner will be
one of them The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center my fiery entrance last night seems to vanish in the presence of my competition The other tributes were jealous of us but not because we were amazing because our stylists were Now I see nothing but

I
give a slight bow and walkstraight toward the exit without being dismissed8As I stride toward the elevator I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist The
doors slide together and I zip upward I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down mycheeks I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room but I fly down the hall into my room bolt the door and fling myself onto my
bed Then I really begin to sob Now Ive done it Now Ive ruined everything If Id stood even a ghost of chance it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers What will they do to me now Arrest me Execute me Cut my tongue and turn
me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem What was I thinking shooting at the Gamemakers Of course I wasnt I was shooting at that apple because I was so angryat being ignored I wasnt trying to kill one of them If I were
theyd be dead Oh what does it matter Its not like I was going to win the Games anyway Who cares what they do to me What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness
Will they take their few belongings or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home or kill them They wouldnt kill them would they Why not What do they care I should have stayed and apologized Or laughed like it was a big joke Then maybe I
would have found some leniency But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door I shout for them to go away and eventually they do It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out
Then I just lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol At first I expect guards to come for me But as time passes it seems less likely I calm down They still need a girl tribute from District
12 dont they If the Gamemakers want to punish me they can do it publicly Wait until Im in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me You can bet theyll make sure I dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself Before that though theyll give me
a score so low no one in their right mind would sponsor me Thats what will happen tonight Since the training isnt open to viewers the Gamemakers announce a score for each player It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games The
number which is between one and twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high signifies the promise of the tribute The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win Its only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training Often because of the variables
in the actual arena highscoring tributes go down almost immediately And a few years ago the boy who won the Games only received a three Still the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a
six or a seven even if Im not particularly powerful Now Im sure Ill have the lowest score of the twentyfour If no one sponsors me my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero When Effie taps on the door tocall me to dinner I decide I may as
well go The scores will be televised tonight Its not like I can hide what happened forever I go to the bathroom and wash my facebut its still red and splotchy Everyones waiting at the table even Cinna and Portia I wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some
reason I dont like the idea of disappointing them Its as if Ive thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup The saltiness reminds me of my tears The adults
begin some chitchat about the weather forecast and I let my eyes meet Peetas He raises his eyebrows A question What happened I just give my head a small shake Then as theyre serving the main course I hear Haymitch say Okay enough small talk just how bad were you
today Peeta jumps in I dont know that it mattered By the time I showed up no one even bothered to look at me They were singing some kind of drinking song I think So I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go That makes
me feel a bit better Its not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers but at least he was provoked too And you sweetheart says Haymitch Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that Im at least able to speak I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers Everyone stops eating
You what The horror in Effies voice confirms my worse suspicions I shot an arrow at them Not exactly at them In their direction Its like Peeta said I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just    I just lost my head so I shot
an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth I say defiantly And what did they say says Cinna carefully Nothing Or I dont know I walked out after that I say Without being dismissed gasps Effie I dismissed myself I said I remember how I promised Prim that

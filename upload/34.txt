instead
of warmth I feel an icy rigidity take over my body My muscles tense as they do before a kill When I speak my voice seems to have dropped an octave I swore I would I bet you did says Caesar giving me a squeeze The buzzer goes off Sorry
were out of time Best of luck Katniss Everdeen tribute from District Twelve The applause continues long after Im seated I look to Cinna for reassurance He gives me a subtle thumbsup Im still in a daze for the first part of Peetas interview He has the audience from the
getgo though I can hear them laughing shouting out He plays up the bakers son thing comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers Tell me do I still smell like roses he asks Caesar and then
theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house Im coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home Peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of his head Handsome lad like you There must be some
special girl Come on whats her name says Caesar Peeta sighs Well there is this one girl Ive had a crush on her ever since I can remember But Im pretty sure she didnt know I was alive until the reaping Sounds of sympathy from the crowd Unrequited love they
can relate to She have another fellow asks Caesar I dont know but a lot of boys like her says Peeta So heres what you do You win you go home She cant turn you down then eh says Caesarencouragingly I dont think its going to work out Winning 
  Wont help in my case says Peeta Why ever not says Caesar mystified Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out Because    Because    She came here with mePART IITHE GAMES10For a moment the cameras hold on Peetas downcast eyes as what he says
sinks in Then I can see my face mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest magnified on every screen as I realize Me He means me I press my lips together and stare at the floor hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside
of me Oh that is a piece of bad luck says Caesar and theres a real edge of pain in his voice The crowd is murmuring in agreement a few have even given agonized cries Its not good agrees Peeta Well I dont think any of us can blame you
Itd be hard not to fall for that young lady says Caesar She didnt know Peeta shakes his head Not until now I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable Wouldnt you love to pull her
back out here and get a response Caesar asks the audience The crowd screams assent Sadly rules are rules and Katniss Everdeens time has been spent Well best of luck to you Peeta Mellark and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with
yours The roar of the crowd is deafening Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me When the audience finally settles down he chokes out a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat We stand for the anthem I
have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached Poor tragic us But I know better After the
anthem the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones so we have only each other for company No one speaks My
elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor Peeta has only just stepped from his car whenI slam my palms into his chest He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers The
urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces Peeta lands in the shards and blood immediately flows from his hands What was that for he says aghast You had no right No right to go saying those things about me I shout at him Now the elevators open and
the whole crew is there Effie Haymitch Cinna and Portia Whats going on says Effie a note of hysteria in her voice Did you fall After she shoved me says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up Haymitch turns on me Shoved him This was your idea wasnt it
Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country I answer It was my idea says Peeta wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms Haymitch just helped me with it Yes Haymitch is very helpful To you I say You are a fool
Haymitch says in disgust Do you think he hurt you That boy just gave yousomething you could never achieve on your own He made me look weak I say He made you look desirable And lets face it you can use all the help you can get in that department
You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted youNow they all do Youre all theyre talking about The starcrossed lovers from District Twelve says Haymitch But were not starcrossed lovers I say Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall Who cares Its

are
deflated but still tender Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it Lace my boots back up Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it but without good results Despite the groosling
and the fish my stomachs growling and I know Im going to have what we call a hollow day back in District 12 Thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly its never enough Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse
so I decide to give into it After all Ive lost a lot of weight in the arena I need some extra calories And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts My last cracker
The groosling neck Thats good because it takes time to pick clean Finally a groosling wing and the bird is history But its a hollow day and even with all that I start daydreaming about foodParticularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol The chicken in creamy orange sauce The
cakes and pudding Bread with butter Noodles in green sauce The lamb and dried plum stew I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time
is over Sort of Dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a mouthful of mint my bow and arrows at hand    This is the most relaxed Ive been since Ive entered the arena If only Rue would show up and we could clear out
As the shadows grow so does my restlessness By late afternoon Ive resolved to go looking for her I can at least visit the spotwhere she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts Before I go I scatter a few mint leaves around
our old campfire Since we gathered these some distance away Rue will understand Ive been here while theyll mean nothing to the Careers In less than an hour Im at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss The wood has
been neatly arranged expertly interspersed with tinder but it has never been lit Rue set up thefire but never made it back here Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point she ran into trouble I have to remind myself
shes still alive Or is she Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up Will she appear in the sky tonight No I refuse to believe it There could be
a hundred other explanations She could have lost her way Run into a pack of predators or another tribute like Thresh and had to hide Whatever happened Im almost certain shes stuck out there somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet Something is keeping her
up a tree I think Ill go hunt it down Its a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon I creep silently through the shadows letting them conceal me But nothing seems suspicious Theres no sign of any kind of struggle no disruption of the needles on
the ground Ive stopped for just a moment when I hear it I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure but there it is again Rues fournote tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth The one that means shes all right I grin and move
in the direction of the bird Another just a short distance ahead picks up on the handful of notes Rue has beensinging to them and recently Otherwise theyd have taken up some other song My eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her I swallow and
sing softly back hoping shell know its safe to join me A mockingjay repeats the melody to me And thats when I hear the scream Its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue And now Im running
knowing this may be a trap knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me but I cant help myself Theres another highpitched cry this time my name Katniss Katniss Rue I shout back so she knows Im near So they know Im near and hopefully the girl who
has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her Rue Im coming When I break into the clearing shes on the ground hopelessly entangled in a net She just has time to reach her hand
through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body18The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck He falls to his knees andhalves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out
the arrow and drowning in his own blood Im reloaded shifting my aim from side to side while I shout at Rue Are there more Are there more She has to say no several times before I hear it Rue has rolled to her side her body curved in and
around the spear I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife freeing her from the net One look at the wound and I know its far beyond my capacity to heal beyond anyones probably The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach

The foxfaced girl from District 5 sly and elusive I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place but even his presence cannot relax me 8 9 10 The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet My palms are sweating like crazy but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and
they skid right of if I try to dry them 11 Rue who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings flutters her way to Caesar A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute Caesars very sweet with her complimenting her
seven in training an excellent score for one so small When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be she doesnt hesitate Im very hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice And if they cant catch me they cant kill me So dont count
me out I wouldnt in a million years says Caesar encouragingly The boy tribute from District 11 Thresh has the same dark skin as Rue but the resemblance stops there Hes one of the giants probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox but I noticed
he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd Instead hes been very solitary speaking to no one showing little interest in training Even so he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers He ignores Caesars attempts at banter and answers
with a yes or no or just remains silent If only I was his size I could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine I bet half thesponsors are at least considering him If I had any money Id bet on him myself And then
theyre calling Katniss Everdeen and I feel myself as if in a dreamstanding and making my way center stage I shake Caesars outstretched hand and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit So Katniss the Capitol must be quite a change from District
Twelve Whats impressed you most since you arrived here asks Caesar What What did he say Its as if the words make no sense My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him I imagine the words coming from
his lips Whats impressed you most since you arrived here I rack my brain for something that made me happy here Be honest I think Be honest The lamb stew I get out Caesar laughs and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in The one with the
dried plums asks Caesar I nod Oh I eat it by the bucketful He turns sideways to the audience in horror hand on his stomach It doesnt show does it They shout reassurances to him and applaud This is what I mean about Caesar He tries to help you out
Now Katniss he says confidentially When you came out in the opening ceremonies my heart actually stopped What did you think of that costume Cinna raises one eyebrow at me Be honest You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive I ask Big laugh A real
one from the audience Yes Start then says Caesar Cinna my friend I should tell him anyway I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume Id ever seen and I couldnt believe I was wearing it I cant believe Im wearing this either I lift up
my skirt to spread it out I mean look at it As the audience oohs and ahs I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger But I know what hes saying Twirl for me I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate Oh do
that again says Caesar and so I lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out letting the dress engulf me in flames The audience breaks into cheers When I stop I clutch Caesars arm Dont stop he says I have to Im dizzy Im
also giggling which I think Ive done maybe never in my lifetime But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me Caesar wraps a protective arm around me Dont worry Ive got you Cant have you following in your mentors footsteps Everyones hooting as the cameras find Haymitch who
is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping and he waves them away goodnaturedly and points back to me Its all right Caesar reassures the crowd Shes safe with me So how about that training score Eleven Give us a hint what happened in there I glance
at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip Um    All I can say is Ithink it was a first The cameras are right on the Gamemakers who are chuckling and nodding Youre killing us says Caesar as if in actual pain Details Details I address
thebalcony Im not supposed to talk about it right The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out Shes not Thank you I say Sorry My lips are sealed Lets go back then to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping says Caesar His mood is
quieter now And you volunteered Can you tell us about her No No not all of you But maybe Cinna I dont think Im imagining the sadness on his face Her names Prim Shes just twelve And I love her more than anything You could hear a pin drop in
the City Circle now What did she say to you After the reaping Caesar asks Be honest Be honest I swallow hard She asked me to try really hard to win The audience is frozen hanging on my every word And what did you say prompts Caesar gently But

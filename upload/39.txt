slips
to the ground Thats when I see the knife in his back Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack Yes the girl from District 2 ten yards away running toward me one hand clutching a halfdozen knives Ive seen her throw in training She
never misses And Im her next target All the general fear Ive been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl this predator who might kill me in seconds Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling thepack over one shoulder and run fullspeed for the woods I can hear
the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head The blade lodges in the pack Both straps on my shoulders now I make for the trees Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me That shell be drawn back into the Cornucopia before
all the good stuff is gone A grin crosses my face Thanks for the knife I think At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn Several lie dead
already on the ground Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while For the
next few hours I alternate between jogging and walking putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it
neatly and tuck it into a pocket I also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated near the handle which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt I dont dare stop to examine the contents of the
pack yet I just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers I can go a long time I know that from my days in the woods But I will need water That was Haymitchs second instruction and since I sort of botched the first I keep a sharp eye
out for any sign of it No luck The woods begin to evolve and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees some I recognize some completely foreign to me At one point I hear a noise and pull my knife thinking I may have to defend myself but
Ive only startled a rabbit Good to see you I whisper Iftheres one rabbit there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared The ground slopes down I dont particularly like this Valleys make me feel trapped I want to be high like in the hills around District 12 where
I can see my enemies approaching But I have no choice but to keep going Funny though I dont feel too bad The days of gorging myself have paid off Ive got staying power even though Im short on sleep Being in the woods is rejuvenating Im glad for the
solitude even though its an illusion because Im probably onscreen right now Not consistently but off and on There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekkingthrough the woods isnt much to look at But theyll show me enough to let people know Im alive
uninjured and on the move One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening when the initial casualties come in But that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players Its late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons Each shot represents
a dead tribute The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed On the opening day they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities I allow
myself to pause panting as I count the shots One    Two    Three    On and on until they reach eleven Eleven dead in all Thirteen left to play My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into
my face Hes gone certainly I wonder about Peeta Has he lasted through the day Ill know in a few hours When they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see All of a sudden Im overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be
already lost bled white collected and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up redressed and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District 12 No longer hereHeading home I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started But
the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out Maybe its better if hes gone already He had no confidence he could win And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him Maybe its better if hes out
of this for good I slump down next to my pack exhausted I need to go through it anyway before night falls See what I have to work with As I unhook the straps I can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color This orange will practically glow
in the dark I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow I flip open the flap What I want most right at this moment is water Haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary I wont last long without it For a few days Ill

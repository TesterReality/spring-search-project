his
attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction The second quickly followed and he sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door tightly behind him I stared at the loaves in disbelief They were fine perfect really except for the burned areas Did
he mean for me to have them He must have Because there they were at my feet Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away The heat of the bread burned into
my skin but I clutched it tighter clinging to life By the time I reached home the loaves had cooled somewhatbut the insides were still warm When I dropped them on the table Prims hands reached to tear off a chunk but I made her sit forced my mother to
join us at the table and poured warm tea I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread We ate an entire loaf slice by slice It was good hearty bread filled with raisins and nuts I put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed and
fell into a dreamless sleep It didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose Might have dropped the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being punished and then delivered them to me But I dismissed this It must have
been an accident Why would he have done it He didnt even know me Still just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered 1 couldnt explain his actions We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school
It was as if spring had come overnight Warm sweet air Fluffy clouds At school I passed the boy in the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened He was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way But as I collected Prim and
started for home that afternoon I found him staring at me from across the school yard Our eyes met for only a second then he turned his headaway I dropped my gaze embarrassed and thats when I saw it The first dandelion of the year A bell went off in
my head I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive To this day I can never shake the connection between this boy Peeta Mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me
that I was not doomed And more than once I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me only to quickly flit away I feel like I owe him something and I hate owing people Maybe if Ihad thanked him at some point Id be
feeling less conflicted now I thought about it a couple of times but the opportunity never seemed to present itself And now it never will Because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thankyou in
there Somehow it just wont seem sincere if Im trying to slit his throat The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread Peeta looks me right in the eye and
gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze Maybe its just a nervous spasm We turn back toface the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays Oh well I think There will be twentyfour of us Odds are someone else will kill him before I
do Of course the odds have not been very dependable of late3The moment the anthem ends we are taken into custody I dont mean were handcuffed or anything but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building Maybe tributes have tried to escape in
the past Ive never seen that happen though Once inside Im conducted to a room and left alone Its the richest place Ive ever been in with thick deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of
the stuff When I sit on the couch I cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones I cannot afford to get
upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose Crying is not an option There will be morecameras at the train station My sister and my mother come first I reach out to Primand she climbs on my lap her arms around my neck headon my shoulder
just like she did when she was a toddler My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us For a few minutes we say nothing Then I start telling themall the things they must remember to do now that I will not be there to do them for
them Prim is not to take any tesserae They can get by iftheyre careful on selling Prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam Gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be
very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as I am Hell also bring them game he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation but they should thank him with some kind of

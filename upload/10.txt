cheek
Then shes gone and Im left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along Finally Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he opens his arms I dont hesitate to go into them His body is familiar to me the way
it moves the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time I really feel it lean and hardmuscled against my own Listen he says Getting a knife should be pretty easy but youve
got to get your hands on a bow Thats your best chance They dont always have bows I say thinking of theyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with Then make one says Gale Even a weak bow is better
than no bow at all I have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results Its not that easy Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes I dont even know if therell be wood I say Another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders
and sand and scruffy bushes I particularly hated that year Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst Theres almost always some wood Gale says Since that year half of them died of cold Not much entertainment in that Its true We spent one Hunger Games
watching theplayers freeze to death at night You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything It was considered very anticlimactic in the Capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths Since then theres usually been wood to make
fires Yes theres usually some I say Katniss its just hunting Youre the best hunter I know says Gale Its not just hunting Theyre armed They think I say So do you And youve had more practice Realpractice he says You know how to kill Not people I say How
different can it be really says Gale grimly The awful thing is that if I can forget theyre people it will be no different at all The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time but theyre taking him away and I start to panic Dont let
them starve I cry out clinging to his hand I wont You know I wont Katniss remember I he says and they yank us apart and slam the door and Ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember Its a short ride from the Justice Building to
the train station Ive never been in a car before Rarely even ridden in wagons In the Seam we travel on foot Ive been right not to cry The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face But Ive had a lot of practice
at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored Peeta Mellark on the other hand has obviously been crying and interestingly
enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games To appear weak and frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting This worked verywell for a
girl Johanna Mason from District 7 a few years back She seemed like such a sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left It turned out she could kill viciously Pretty clever the way she played it But this seems
an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because hes a bakers son All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broadshouldered and strong It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him We have to stand for a
few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us The train begins to move at once The speed initially takes my breath away Of course Ive never been on a train as travel
between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties For us thats mainly transporting coal But this is no ordinary coal train Its one of the highspeed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day In school they
tell us the Capitolwas built in a place once called the Rockies District 12 was in a region known isAppalachia Even hundreds of years ago they mined coal here Which is why our miners have to dig so deep Somehow it all comes back to coal at school Besides basic
reading and math most of our instruction is coalrelated Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem Its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol I know there must be more than theyre telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion
But I dont spend much time thinking about it Whatever the truth is I dont see how it will help me get food on the table The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom
a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water We dont have hot water at home unless we boil it There are drawers filled with fine clothes and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want wear anything I want everything is at my

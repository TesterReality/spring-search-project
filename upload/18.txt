the anthem and escort us into the Training Center which will be our homeprison untilthe Games begin The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by snowwhite horses They look so beautiful spraypainted silver in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels District 1 makes luxury items for the
Capitol You can hear the roar of the crowd They are always favorites District 2 gets into position to follow them Inno time at all we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray The tributes from
District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch Here we go then he says and before we can react he sets our capes on fire I gasp waiting for the heat but there is only a faint tickling sensation Cinna climbs up before us and
ignites our headdresses He lets out a sign of relief It works Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea He shouts something up at us but the music drowns
him out He shouts again and gestures Whats he saying I ask Peeta For the first time I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames he is dazzling And I must be too I think he said for us to hold hands says Peeta He grabs
my right hand in his left and we look to Cinna for confirmation He nods and gives a thumbsup and thats the last thing I see before we enter the city The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve Every head is
turned our way pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us At first Im frozen but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look In the deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces We seem to be
leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes Cinna was right about the minimal makeup we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you I hear Cinnas voice in my head I lift my chin a bit higher put on my
most winning smile and wave with my free hand Im glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance he is so steady solid as a rock As I gain confidence I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd The people of the Capitol are going nuts showering us
with flowers shouting our names our first names which they have bothered to find on the program The pounding music the cheers the admiration work their way into my blood and I cant suppress my excitement Cinna has given me a great advantage No one will forget me Not my
look not my nameKatniss The girl who was on fire For the first time I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me Surely there must be one sponsor willing to take me on And with a little extra help some food the right weapon why should I count
myself out of the Games Someone throws me a red rose I catch it give it a delicate sniff and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing Katniss
Katniss I can hear my name being called from all sides Everyone wants my kisses Its not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must have completely stopped the circulation in Peetas hand Thats how tightly Ive been holding it I lookdown at our linked fingers as
I loosen my grasp but he regains his grip on me No dont let go of me he says The firelight flickers off his blue eyes Please I might fall out of this thing Okay I say So I keep holding on but I cant help feeling strange about the
way Cinna has linked us together Its not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle On the buildings that surround the Circle every window is packed with the
most prestigious citizens of the Capitol Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snows mansion and we come to a halt The music ends with a flourish The president a small thin man with paperwhite hair gives the official welcome from a balcony above us It is traditional
to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime The darker it becomes the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering When the national anthem
plays they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera holds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center The doors have only just shut behind us when
were engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise As I glance around I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks which confirms what Ive suspected weve literally outshone them all Then Cinna and Portia are there helping us
down from the chariot carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister I realize Im still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open We both massage our hands Thanksfor keeping hold of me I was getting

She nods and disappears Theres a rustling in a nearby tree Then the same noise again a bit farther off I realize shes leaping from tree to tree Its all I can do not to laugh out loud Is this what she showed the Gamemakers I imagine her flying around
the training equipment never touching the floor She should have gotten at least a ten Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east I cant afford to wait any longer Compared to the agony of last nights climb this one is a cinch At the tree limb that holds the
nest I position the knife in the groove and Im about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving There on the nest The bright goldgleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface No question its acting a little subdued
but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands beading up through the ointment and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt If I dont get through this
branch in a matter of seconds the entire swarm could emerge and attack me Theres no sense in putting it off I take a deep breath grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can Back forth back forth The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I
hear them coming out Back forth back forth A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in Back forth back forth And just as the knife cuts through I shove the end of the branch as far away
from me as I can It crashes down through the lower branches snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground The nest bursts open like an egg and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air I feel
a second sting on the cheek a third on my neck and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh Fortunately only these three tracker jackers hadidentified me before the nest went down
The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground Its mayhem The Careers have woken to a fullscale tracker jacker attack Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt I can hear cries of To the lake To the lake and know
they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects Glimmer and another girl the one from District 4 are not so lucky They receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view Glimmer appears
to go completely mad shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless She calls to the others for help but of course no one returns The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight although I wouldnt bet on her making it to the
lake I watch Glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes and then go still The nest is nothing but an empty shell The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others I dont think theyll return but I dont want to risk it I scamper
down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water just in case any wasps are still on my trailAfter
about five minutes I drag myself onto the rocks People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings Actually the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size A foulsmelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers
The swelling The pain The ooze Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground Its a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon I dont want to think about what Glimmer must look like now Her body disfigured Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow 
  The bow Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and Im on my feet teetering through the trees back to Glimmer The bow The arrows I must get them I havent heard the cannons fire yet so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma
her heart still struggling against the wasp venom But once it stops and the cannon signals her death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body taking the only bow and sheath of arrows Ive seen out of the Games for good And I refuse to let them slip
through my fingers again I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires The tracker jackers have vanished This girl so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews is unrecognizable Her features eradicated herlimbs three times their normal size The stinger lumps have begun to explode spewing
putrid green liquid around her I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the flesh disintegratesin my
hands and I fall back on the ground Is this real Or have the hallucinations begun I squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth ordering myself not to become sick Breakfast must stay down it might be days before I can hunt again A second

and
to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts Do my work quietly in school Make only polite small talk in the public market Discuss little more than trades in the Hob which is the black market where I make most of
my money Even at home where I am less pleasant I avoid discussing tricky topics Like the reaping or food shortages or the Hunger Games Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be
myself Gale I can feel themuscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place a rock ledgeoverlooking a valley A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile Gale says I never
smile except in the woods Hey Catnip says Gale My real name is Katniss but when I first told him I had barely whispered it So he thought Id said Catnip Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname
for me I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company But I got a decent price for his pelt Look what I shot Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and
I laugh Its real bakery bread not the flat dense loaves we make from our grain rations I take it in my hands pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva Fine bread like
this is for special occasions Mm still warm I say He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it What did it cost you Just a squirrel Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says Gale Even wished me luck Well
we all feel a little closer today dont we I say not even bothering to roll my eyes Prim left us a cheese I pull it out His expression brightens at the treat Thank you Prim Well have a real feast Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he
mimics Effie Trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping I almost forgot Happy Hunger Games He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us And may the odds He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me
I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue Be ever in your favor I finish with equal verve We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits Besides the
Capitol accent is so affected almost anything sounds funny in it I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread He could be my brother Straight black hair olive skin we even have the same gray eyes But were not related at least not closely Most of
the families who work the mines resemble one another this way Thats why my mother and Prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place They are My mothers parents were part of the small merchant class thatcaters to officials Peacekeepers and the occasional Seam customer
They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12 Since almost no one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into
remedies She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while her children turned to skin and bones Itry to forgive her for my fathers sake But
to be honest Im not the forgiving type Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries We settle back in a nook in the rocks From this place we are invisible but have
a clear view of the valley which is teeming with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish iridescent in the sunlight The day is glorious with a blue sky and soft breeze The foods wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in
our mouths Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale hunting for tonights supper But instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out We
could do it you know Gale says quietly What I ask Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it says Gale I dont know how to respond The idea is so preposterous If we didnt have so many kids he adds quickly
Theyre not our kids of course But they might as well be Gales two little brothers and a sister Prim And you may as well throw in our mothers too because how would they live without us Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more With both
of us hunting daily there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling I never want to have kids I say I might If I didnt live here says Gale But

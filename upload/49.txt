inside
the fence of District 12 When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest we immediately head in the opposite direction So is that what hangs above me I look back to Rue for help but shes melted into her tree Given my circumstances I guess it doesnt matter
what type of wasp nest it is Im wounded and trapped Darkness has given me a brief reprieve but by the time the sun rises the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me Theres no way they could do otherwise after Ive made them look so stupid That
nest may be the sole option I have left If I can drop it down on them I may be able to escape But Ill risk my life in the process Of course Ill never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest tocut it free Ill
have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that But can my hands And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm And what if the Careers figure out what Im
doing and move their camp That would defeat the whole purpose I realize that the best chance Ill have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during theanthem That could begin any time I drag myself out of my bag make sure my knife is secured in my
belt and begin to make my way up the tree This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me but I persevere When I reach the limb that supports the nest the humming becomes more distinctive But its still oddly subdued if these are
tracker jackers Its the smoke I think Its sedated them This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out Its now or never I think and begin to saw Blisters burst on my right
hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth Once Ive got a groove the work requires less effort but is almostmore than I can handle I grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today Thats all right
The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me But the anthems running out and Im only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark and Im forced to stop Now what I could probably finish
off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan If the wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way down if I try to escape this could all be a deadly waste of time Better I think to sneak up here
at dawn and send the nest into my enemies In the faint light of the Careers torches I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise Ive ever had Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute My first gift
from a sponsor Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand What can it be Not food surely I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that its medicine Cautiously I probe the surface of the
ointment The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes Oh Haymitch I whisper Thank you He has not abandoned me Not left me to fend entirely for myself The cost of this medicine must be astronomical Probablynot one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot To me it
is priceless I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf The effect is almost magical erasing the pain on contact leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants its hightech medicine
brewed up in the Capitols labs When my calf is treated I rub a thin layer into my hands After wrapping the pot in the parachute I nestle it safely away in my pack Now that the pain has eased its all I can do to reposition myself in my
bag before I plunge into sleep A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning In the gray morning light I examine my hands The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft babyskin pink My leg still feels
inflamed but that burn was far deeperI apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear Whatever happens Im going to have to move and move fast I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water Almost nothing
stayed in my stomach yesterday and Im already starting to feel the effects of hunger Below me Ican see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground By her position leaning up against the trunk of the tree Id guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard but fatigue
overcame her My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me but I cant make out Rue Since she tipped me off it only seems fair to warn her Besides if Im going to die today its Rue I want to win Even if it means
a little extra food for my family the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable I call Rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear wide and alert at once She points up to the nest again I hold up my knife and make a sawing

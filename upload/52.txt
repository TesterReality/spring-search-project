it
I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue The sweetness spreads through my mouth down my throat warming my veins with memories of summer and my home woods and
Gales presence beside me For some reason our discussion from that last morning comes back to me We could do it you know What Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it And suddenly Im not thinking ofGale but of Peeta and
  Peeta He saved my life I think Because by the time we met up I couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine But if he did and my instincts tell me he did what for Is he simply working
the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview Or was he actually trying to protect me And if he was what was he doing with those Careers in the first place None of it makes sense I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then
I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts So I focus on the one really good thing thats happened since I landed in the arena I have a bow and arrows A full dozen
arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them I can
clean them later but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home but who cares That I can work with Theweapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games
I know I have tough opponents left to face But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures If Cato broke through the trees right now I wouldnt flee Id shoot I find Im actually anticipating the moment with pleasure But first I have
to get some strength back in my body Im very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone plus several more pounds as well My hip bones and ribs
are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death And then there are my wounds to contend with burns cuts and bruises from smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker stings which are as sore and swollen as ever I treat my
burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well but it has no effect on them My mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf that could draw out the poison but she seldom had cause to use it and I dont even
remember its name let alone its appearance Water first I think You can hunt along the way now Its easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage So I walk off in the otherdirection hoping my enemies still
lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom I cant move too quickly my joints reject any abrupt motions But I establish the slow hunters tread I use when tracking game Within a few minutes I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and
arrow Its not my usual clean shot through the eye but Ill take it After about an hour I find a stream shallow but wide and more than sufficient for my needs The suns hot and severe so while Iwait for my water to purify I strip down to my
underclothes and wade into the mild current Im filthy from head to toe I try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns After rinsing out
my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit untangling my hair with my fingers My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef With a handful of moss I polish the blood from my
silver weapons Refreshed I treat my burns again braid back my hair and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun will dry them soon enough Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course ofaction Im traveling uphill now which I prefer with a source of fresh water
not only for myself but possible game I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey Anyway it looks plenty edible to me By late afternoon I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help conceal the
smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall I clean the game taking extra care with the bird but theres nothing alarming about it Once the feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken but its plump and firm Ive just placed the first lot over the coals
when I hear the twig snap In one motion I turn to the sound bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder Theres no one there No one I can see anyway Then I spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of

swiftly
as possible That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control Peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight I make him lie down before I probe his wound Warm slippery blood runs over my fingers A bandage will not be enough Ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a
handful of times and try to replicate it I cut free a sleeve from my shirt wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee and tie a half knot I dont have a stick so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot twisting it
as tightly as I dare Its risky business Peeta may end up losing his leg but when I weigh this against him losing his life what alternative do I have I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him Dont go to sleep I
tell him Im not sure if this is exactly medical protocol but Im terrified that if he drifts off hell never wake again Are you cold he asks He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me Its a bit warmer sharingour body heat
inside my double layer of jackets but the night is young The temperature will continue to drop Even now I can feel the Cornucopia which burned so when I first climbed it slowly turning to ice Cato may win this thing yet I whisper to Peeta Dont you believe it
he says pulling up my hood but hes shaking harder than I am The next hours are the worst in my life which if you think about it is saying something The cold would be torture enough but the real nightmare is listening to Cato moaning begging and finally just
whimpering as the mutts work away at him After a very short time I dont care who he is or what hes done all I want is for his suffering to end Why dont they just kill him I ask PeetaYou know why he says and pulls me closer to
him And I do No viewer could turn away from the show now From the Gamemakers point of view this is the final word in entertainment It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow erasing everything but the
present which I begin to believe will never change There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in thehorn Peeta begins to doze off now and each time he does I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if
he goes and dies on me now I know Ill go completely insane Hes fighting it probably more for me than for him and its hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him so
I cant let him go I just cant The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens the subtle shift of the moon So Peeta begins pointing it out to me insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes for just a moment I feel a flicker of
hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again Finally I hear him whisper that the sun is rising I open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn I can see too how bloodless Peetas face has become How little time he has
left And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol Still no cannon has fired I press my good ear against the horn and can just make out Catos voice I think hes closer now Katniss can you shoot him Peeta asks If hes near the mouth
I may be able to take him out It would be an act of mercy at this point My last arrows in your tourniquet I say Make it count says Peeta unzipping his jacket letting me loose So I free the arrow tying thetourniquet back as tightly as my frozen
fingers can manage I rub my hands together trying to regain circulation When I crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge I feel Peetas hands grip me for support It takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light in the blood Then
the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound and I know where his mouth is And I think the word hes trying to say is please Pity not vengeance sends my arrow flying into his skull Peeta pulls me back up bow in hand
quiver empty Did you get him he whispers The cannon fires in answer Then we won Katniss he says hollowly Hurray for us I get out but theres no joy of victory in my voice A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue the remaining mutts bound
into it disappearing as the earth closes above them We wait for the hovercraft to take Catos remains for the trumpets of victory that should follow but nothing happens Hey I shout into air Whats going on The only response is the chatter of waking birds Maybe its the body
Maybe we have to move away from it says Peeta I try to remember Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tributeon the final kill My brain is too muddled to be sure but what else could be the reason for the delay Okay Think you could make
it to the lake I ask Think I better try says Peeta We inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground If the stiffness in my limbs is this bad how can Peeta even move I rise first swinging and bending my arms and

Then
wheres the cannon Someone should go back Make sure the jobs done Yeah we dont want to have to track her down twice I said shes dead An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others Were wasting time Ill go finish her and lets move on I almost
fall out of the tree The voice belongs to Peeta12Thank goodness I had the foresight to belt myself in Ive rolled sideways off the fork and Im facing the ground held in place by the belt one hand and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag braced against
the trunk There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it Go on then Lover Boy says the boy from District 2 See for yourself I just get a glimpse of Peeta lit by
a torch heading back to the girl by the fire His face is swollen with bruises theres a bloody bandage on one arm and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat I remember him shaking him his head telling me not to go into the fight for the
supplies when all along all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do Okay I can stomach that Seeing all those supplies was tempting But this    This other thing This teaming up with
the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us No one from District 12 would think of doing such a thing Career tributes are overly vicious arrogant better fed but only because theyre the Capitols lapdogs Universally solidly hated by all but those from their own districts I
can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace Obviously the noble boy on the rooftopwas playing just one more game with me But this will be his last I will eagerly watch the night skies for
signs of his death if I dont kill him first myself The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot then use hushed voices Why dont we just kill him now and get it over with Let him tag along Whats the harm And hes handy with
that knife Is he Thats news What a lot of interesting things Im learning about my friend Peeta today Besides hes our best chance of finding her It takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me Why You think she bought into that sappy
romance stuff She might have Seemed pretty simpleminded to me Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress I want to puke Wish we knew how she got that eleven Bet you Lover Boy knows The sound of Peeta returning silences them Was she dead asks the
boy from District 2 No But she isnow says Peeta Just then the cannon fires Ready to move on The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break and birdsong fills the air I remain in my awkward position muscles trembling with exertion for a
while longer then hoist myself back onto my branch I need to get down to get going but for a moment I lie there digesting what Ive heard Not only is Peeta with the Careers hes helping them find me The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because
of her eleven Because she can use a bow and arrow Which Peeta knows better than anyone But he hasnt told them yet Is he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive Is he still pretending to love me for the audience What is going
on in his head Suddenly the birds fall silent Then one gives a highpitched warning call A single note Just like the one Gale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes A set of huge metal teeth drops down
Slowly gently the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft Then it vanishes The birds resume their song Move I whisper to myself I wriggle out of my sleeping bag roll it up and place it in the pack I take a deep breath While Ive been concealed by
darkness and the sleeping bag and the willowbranches it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me I know they must be tracking me now though The minute I hit the ground Im guaranteed a closeup The audience will have been beside themselves knowing
I was in the tree that I overheard the Careers talking that I discovered Peeta was with them Until I work out exactly how I want to play that Id better at least act on top of things Not perplexed Certainly not confused or frightened No I need to look
one step ahead of the game So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light I pause a second giving the cameras time to lock on me Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile There Let them figure outwhat
that means Im about to take off when I think of my snares Maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close But have to Too many years of hunting I guess And the lure of possible meat Im rewarded with one fine rabbit In no time Ive
cleaned and gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin and innards under a pile of leaves Im wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a lesson I learned the hard way when I think of the dead tribute I hurryback to her
